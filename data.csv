AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I order 3 of them and one of the item is bad quality. Is missing backup spring so I have to put a pcs of aluminum to make the battery work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Bulk is always the less expensive way to go for products like these
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Well they are not Duracell but for the price i am happy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seem to work as well as name brand batteries at a much better price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are very long lasting the price is great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Bought a lot of batteries for Christmas and the AmazonBasics Cell have been good. I haven't noticed a difference between the brand name batteries and the Amazon Basic brand. Just a lot easier to purchase and have arrive at the house and have on hand. Will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,ive not had any problame with these batteries have ordered them in the past been very pleased.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Well if you are looking for cheap non-rechargeable batteries that last quite a while then these are perfect. Nothing more to say.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These do not hold the amount of high power juice like energizer or duracell, but they are half the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,AmazonBasics AA AAA batteries have done well by me appear to have a good shelf life. I'll buy them again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I find amazon basics batteries to be equal if not superior to name brand ones. Can't believe I didn't start buying them sooner! The packages are large and the price is great too.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"When I first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them. With recent purchases, they do not seem to last like they had, or maybe a mixed-bag (inconsistent with some lasting better than others). I have not done any tests, but feel some other brands may last longer. However, the price is hard to beat."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Use it for my fish tank's light at night and works great, I love how you can easily switch it off and on if you want it on while guests are there."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"just got em so I can't really comment on how good the do the job, good price, quick delivery but have only put two into one of my keyboards but they can go up to a year so who can say after three days"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,we have many things that need aa battery they are great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Thankful that I was able to find on Amazon for a great price and even better shipping. Arrived in perfect condition and did exactly what I needed it to. Great purchase and would purchase again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I don't know if I would buy thus brand again seems like they don't last as long as Duracell
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They don't last as long as the brand name but are good enough considering they are much cheaper.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Bought these batteries for my Christmas gifts the month of (december) only lasted like 2months toys now need replacement batteries . I also used some for my doorbell and just now needs replacement batteries. Tv Remote control is still working but these batteries don't last very long...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,This my second order and they seem to work as good as name brand and ship to my door.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This was my second purchase of amazon batteries and they work great. Just as good or even better than name brand batteries and half the price. This will be the only way I purchase batteries from now on!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They last as long as Duracell batteries in my Xbox one controllers and none of them exploded like some of the reviews said.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,they seemed to not last as long as other name brand names disappointed!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These do not last long at all very cheap batteries no happy
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,have not used yet but a battery is a battery good price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We've ordered these a few times cause we've been so happy with product. These are good quality. We are also happy with price. I would recommend these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,HAVE NOT HAD CHANCE TO USE ALL OF THEM BUT HOPEFULLY ALL OF THEM WILL REMAIN IN GOOD ORDER FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME MEANING A FEW YEARS OUT.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"these were under a light we thought they were there to fit the light when they arrived and nice company they were not the batteries we needed it should have been aa but that is ok,it was our fault not knowing this. thanks.."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I use these batteries in my game cameras and they work great, last several weeks."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very convenient to have a box of batteries and at a good price. No longer need to compare pricing in stores. Should have done this long time ago.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Not much to say about batteries except they work for a good price. Having a hundred let's me share with kids and grand kids.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They seem to work okay so far and the price was great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I use them for my Xbox controllers and they last pretty long. Great for a cheap price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seem to hold up as well as any name brand and at a much better price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works just as well as every other brand of battery with a better price. Powers all of my sons toys for months at a time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Just got them so i really wont kno for a few eeeks or so how good these batteries are
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These last as well as Energizer- half the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"3rd purchase of these AA from Amazon, all have expiration of 2027. Ones I've used thus far last as Long as name brands"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am 100 satisfied with my purchase of these batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I put these batteries in 10 of the 12 window candles that I bought - I put my last 2 Duracell in the other 2. The Amazon Batteries lasted for about 10 days and the Duracell lasted for 12. Since then I've experimented to see if this is consistent . It is, the Duracell last an average of 17 longer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Junk batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seem to work very well at a great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries don't last even in a simple digital clock. 2 weeks at best.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I buy AAA and AA batteries about 4 - 6 times a year. I made the switch to Amazon batteries about 2 years ago and never looked back. These batteries work just as well as any of the name brands, but at a much more reasonable cost."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Date on the back of these were 1992. Yeah, 1992. Inedible."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"GOT THE 48 PACK, I USEDD THEM UP FASTER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD!!,SO IM ORDERING MORE !! SO IM ORDERING MORE NOW"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I definitely love the price and quantity.. My kids go tthrough them to fast. At least these will last a while..
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They worked and great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries. Standard AA kind. We use them everyday. They power many things and these work as good or better than any others.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent performance and better price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Arrived earlier than expected. Amazon batteries are not only affordable, but have a long life."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great product!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,LOVE THESE BATTERIES! BETTER THAN DURACELL AND SAVES ME MONEY! THANK YOU FOR A GREAT PRODUCT AMAZON!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon you rock! These work better than name brand batteries and cost nothing. Have the same nice feel of expensive batteries too. Perfect in my opinion, will re purchase!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazing so far. These AAA's are even more affordable than the brands at WalMart. Will update if they end up not being good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,works great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am happy to report that this order is working fine with no issues. I am very satisfied with this order and plan to buy again from same seller. Thank you. Jn
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Battery storage life only lasted 8 months (stored indoors).
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,A good bang for your buck!! Almost everything now a days uses batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"If it's possible to have gotten a dud batch I sure got it. We BLEW through all these batteries in less than a month. My kids toys aren't that super powered and even in remotes I was having to change batteries way too often. For example the magic touch counting toy, the store batteries lasted 3 years. Popped in some Amazon batteries, 1 month and the second child didn't play with it nearly as much as the first. For the price it was worth the try but I'm going back to the other brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,NICE PRODUCT
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great basic batteries! Fantastic price. I like having a stockpile. When my kids get toys at Christmas I feel like Oprah. YOU get a battery! and YOU get a battery!...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Some day we will probably look back and chuckle about 'primitive' batteries like these. But not yet. They are an integral part of our daily lives. We need food, drink, shelter, love, and BATTERIES! You can't beat the price/quality combination."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,A battery is a battery these work just as good if not better than the name brands like Duracell or Enginzer
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I like to have a good stock of batteries in my home. I am a repeat purchaser of these and other sizes. So far no performance issues. Lasts like Duracell. They might consider improving the graphics though, not very exciting to look at."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These worked out great for his battery powered cars I got him. What a awesome deal.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I used to buy batteries from Costco which come under Kirkland brand. I thought of testing Amazon Basics based on my experience of other Amazon Basics products in the past. These batteries are way better than Kirkland, Energizer and Duracell. The cost is nicely placed. Now my kids have more time to play with toys before the need to replace the batteries. A clear thumbs up!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Got it and it's already in use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Never purchased these before ... Work well so far
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,lasts just as long as duracell
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought the smaller pack last time and didn't realize how quickly it runs out. Very happy with this amount of batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Like that I can buy these online and in bulk. Have ordered them several times. A good buy
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,What can I say Thes batteries work as xpected.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,This large pack of batteries is a cheap alternative to buying other brand names and are particularly useful for gaming. The battery life is every bit as good as the brand name batteries as well. I use these batteries for frequent gaming to power my controller and headset.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good deal for rechargeable. They all work and seem to preform well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries at a good price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They seem to have some good staying power and are cheaper than most other brands. I highly recommend as this box lasts quite a few months with the kids mainly using these for xbox controllers.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are a good value and work well. I have used them in the past and would recommend them to all.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,A friend advised me to buy my batteries from Amazon. Her family swears by them. I am now using them and agree they are a good buy for the money and I am not worried about running out of batteries or running out to have to buy them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries are pretty much of a commodity as long as they do what they're supposed to do, so I ordered these based on their price -- much cheaper than what you can buy in a store. And these batteries seem to last as long as any of the name brands. A good value."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These Amazon batteries seem like a good value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Everyone needs AA batteries. These are fine and a great price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"so many batteries, so little money. A great deal"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Works great for everyday AA battery needs
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I got tired of running back and forth to the local store to buy a small package of batteries therefore, I decided to order these since the cost for all of these batteries were approximately the same cost for 6 batteries in a pack. The price was right and the batteries are working very well. This is really a bargain."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great buy for the money - these batteries work very well. I've gotten them in the past. The best part is that they are so inexpensive that you can run through them, and not feel like you're running through your bank account!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"A great deal, and the batteries have a good life to them. I will buy again when I start running low."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"All I buy now is AmazonBasics when it comes to batteries. They are long lasting and a great price. I have tried the AA, AAA, and 9-volt. As a cheap shopper, I am pleased with their performance and price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Between LeapPads, Xbox controllers and remotes, we use batteries a lot. These have held up great with a comparable lifespan to other household brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I buy all my batteries here. Great long lasting batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"You know those crazy cheap batteries that are so light you practically hit yourself in the face when you pick one up These aren't those.I've already purchased a couple sets of these and have been really happy with the quality/lifespan. I'd say they're DEFINTELY comparable to the more expensive name brands. I've happily recommended them to friends and family, and it's so handy always having plenty of AA batteries, especially around birthdays and holidays!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,My PS3 remote control and my television remote controls work again thanks to these AAA batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"As a teacher, I need tons of batteries, but I refused to spend excessive amounts on them, so I figured this was the best option! They are long-lasting, worth the money, cute (if that even matters, lol)! You won't find a deal like this in stores!I highly recommend!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Ive been buying these since they started selling them. The last batch, I had one that leaked. It was in a rather expensive candle, so a heads up for those using this battery to check once in a while. Ive never had this happen before. It turned all brown on one side and could have ruined my candle if I didnt clean it out real good. The battery was only week old, used infrequently in an air conditioned home. I will still continue to buy these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I can only use these on those indoor flameless candles and even then, they dont last very long...a little disappointed..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Lieutenant Dan got me these batteries. So then I got a call from him, saying we dont have to worry about batteries no more. And I said, thats good! One less thing. -Forrest"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"A lot of batteries for the money. So far, all working well."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great Batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I happen to have remote controls in our house and this item certainly is a must in my living room.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"You know you need them, so why not get a bunch. I'm the battery guy for the kids toys, so I have to keep them on hand at all times!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Worked exactly as they are supposed to, good price, good quality. lasting a nice long time, A good buy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is a great purchase. My outdoor cameras on my house them. Compared to the leading namebrands, I find these to last longer. I am getting four months per pair of batteries instead of three months with my surveillance cameras."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've been buying AAA alkaline batteries in packages of four at the dollar store and thought I was getting a pretty good deal on the price, but it bothered me to have to throw away so much packaging every time I needed four batteries. Then I was checking out a fellow reviewer's profile and found a review of the AmazonBasics AAA batteries. He (or she, I can't remember) claimed these work as well or better than name brands and are even less expensive than the dollar store deals and with much less waste in the packaging.So I ordered some and his advice was right on the money. I've used them (so far) in small flashlights and in one of my TENS machines. Great performance. The price (which seems to fluctuate) is less than I was paying locally. Best of all, you get 36 batteries in a tiny cardboard box that measures 4 1/4 x 2 1/4 x 2 1/4. There are 9 sealed packages of 4 batteries each, but there's much less waste in the packaging. Amazon claims 10-year, no-leak shelf life for them, but even I use batteries faster than that.I think this is a great product at a great price and I love the packaging. Glad I stumbled onto them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Thats a whole lot of batteries! I ordered the 48 pack of AA batteries and its so much cheaper than a much smaller branded pack from the big chain stores. They arrived packaged well and wrapped nicely, see included pictures for details. I like to keep extra batteries around because most new electronics do not have included batteries these days. I hate getting a device in the mail and scavenging the house for batteries or stealing them from the remote controls. At this price, we can all afford to keep a bunch on hand. Ive tested these on several devices so far and they appear to be comparable to brand name batteries, they last a long time and bring all my electronics to life with renewed vigor. I'll definitely be buying more in the future."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"of course these are no energizer bunny batteries, but for the price and amount you get, you cant beat it! They come in individual packs of 4, inside a white box to keep them in. I would recommend it"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"A good deal, well packed in reusable package"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,During my first recharging they were leaking and wrapping was coming off. A waste of money
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,TERRIBLE! Barely lasted three hours during a digital camera shoot where Duracell lasts multiple days.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought these batteries to use with a battery operated pump that transfers gas from a gas can into the tank of my riding mower. This is a far better way of fueling my mower than trying to lift a five gallon tank and trying to empty it into the mower tank. The pump uses 4 AA batteries and that is the way the Amazon batteries are packaged. Having them bundled in foursomes is convenient. My pump runs perfectly with these batteries.These batteries are said to have a shelf life of ten years so I won't be having to buy more AA batteries for at least that long. The price of these batteries is a genuine bargain and is it highly recommended to get this offer if AA batteries are needed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seem to work fone for a fraction of the price!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far I have had no complaints with these batteries. I was hesitate at first because they were cheaper than your big name brands. I figured they may not last long. But I was proven wrong. They have lasted just as long as the big name brands, and they are a lot cheaper. I buy these for work and for home. They do not disappoint me at either place."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These Amazon AA batteries are great. They are just as good as any high priced battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Yes, I'm using these and they are as good as any other battery."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for affordable AA batteries with a long shelf life that I could keep around for an emergency or extended power outage. These Amazon alkaline batteries are advertised as having 10 years shelf life, and after receiving them I confirmed that on each battery is printed the expiration year 2025, which is what I expected having bought them in 2015.Now I won't have to by ordinary batteries that end up discharging internally in just a few years. The environment and my pocket are grateful. Thanks Amazon!"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good less expensive bulk pack. Great alternative for toys and games that seem to eat batteries and won't break the bank. Seem to work well enough and rival the name brands. Will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You get what you pay for in life bht for the lrice and amount these are actually great one say or two days of strong power for flashlights or wireless headphones etc. For remotes theyblast for quite a while. Package was nice fast delivery thunking of actually buying different sizes for other electronics ...would definitly order again ...kinda like gas not premium or regular something like a plus ....lol i have tried all those other expensive brands thats supposed to last 10x more longer well by the time you pay for one pack and get maybe a months wirth depending on usage you could have a 100 of these and still have left over......just saying your not buying tires or brakes for your car so test them out they sell it in smaller amounts and subscdiption amount etc....
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,For most applications they seem to do a decent job. Have used them for about 3 years.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"They didn't last very long in my cheap camera. With them not being lithium I didn't expect them to last forever, but I should of gotten more then a days use out of them. In my Xbox controller they lasted an adequate amount of time. So all in all these definitely aren't for heavy use and the price point reflects that."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Adequate performance. I just pulled 16 batteries from four night lights. Half of these were the AmazonBasics AA batteries. Not surprising until I tell you that that AmazonBasics batteries were the last to be installed and the other half were installed long before the AmazonBasics. I don't think I'll buy these again.

From my experience these products do just as well as any name brand product but with less experience. Love the packaging these batteries came in and so far from what I can tell work like a charm.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I've never had a problem with any of Amazons stuff. I actually prefer it over namebrand because of the cost-effectiveness if it's not something that's going to show and look tacky I could care less... batteries are one of them
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are decent but I find they last about 20 less than Duracell batteries, but considering the cost difference they are actually worth it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon basics batteries are just as good as the name brands from my experience.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work great and are a great price. Can't beat that! These seem to be on par with low to mid tier brand battery live so can't complain.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are quality batteries...just as good as major brand names. Can't beat the price. Thank you.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, these hold up really well. For the price, they are simply unbeatable. They come packaged in a small, generic box. I've now tried 4 AmazonBasics products, and I haven't got a complaint about any so far. Amazon seems to not only want to make cheap products, but they also don't seem to want to get complaints and returns as well. Who has time for all of the mess So, do it right the first time, and see what happens.Thanks for another great product!*If my review was helpful in any way, please click the little YES button. If not, just laugh and move on."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"My 37 days old Amazon fire stick quit working, the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasn't getting any juice. Tried 3 different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldn't work-and yes, I put them in the right way. Contacted Amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past 30 days purchased and couldn't return, but before sending back for warranty service and being without TV for who knows how long and just to make sure, I bought some energizer batteries. Wouldn't you know it, the remote fired right back up. Can't trust these batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I use hundreds of AAAs annually, and despite the graphics in ad, these are about the poorest performing, with least longevity, of any I have bought. Still have another 100 of these, but will likely go thru those quickly."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,HOPE THEY WORK!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"First of all- buying batteries is never fun . It's also quite expensive. I fell in love with the fact , I could buy these Amazon branded batteries through prime and get them in two days .But guess what. I got them in 1 day!!! Plus , I stocked up for all those dang Christmas toys for my triplets. If I buy one, I have to buy three!!!!They lasted just as long as a standard battery . Plus , I love that they come in a nice cardboard sleeve. Rather than the ones at the store where they all fall out when you rip the plastic from the cardboard.To wrap up- these were very impressive."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work great. I primarily use them in my xbox 36 controller and they last as long if not longer than any other brand i have used. I highly recommend them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"good price, worked fine"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheep and effective these batteries compare to mainstream manufacturers without issue. The price tag is so much lower that even if you didn't like them or felt that a major manufacturer was somehow better than this you probably still wouldn't regret the purchase. They hold their charge and last just as long as anything else. Amazon Strikes again with a great product
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seems to be as good as the average battery bought in a store. Nice amount for a good price. I buy all my batteries from Amazon now
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries can be expensive! However, Amazon has taken the opportunity to sell a good quality product. There are plenty of batteries for the cost, and in these times of uncertainty we need to be prepared for our family. During times of power outage batteries are so comforting because they allow us to maintain a sense comfort. They also sell these in triple a, c, and d. The price is good compared to other brands, and the quality of Amazon is backing the product. Safe and good buy for any consumer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great for the price and last long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,stronger than duracell and so much cheaper. amazon keep up the great work
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Does not last as long as Duracell quantum. These were sent as a supplement
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These are budget friendly but don't last! I bought for my battery operated candles that typically use batteries for 6-8 weeks. Twice these batteries barely lasted 1 week. It was so disappointing. Amazon produce are usually so good, but I would not recommend these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries were inexpensive, work well in multiple devices.I hate running out of triple A batteries!"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They're batteries. Significantly more cost effective than Duracel Energizer. Rated 4* because I can't yet say how they last compared to the two big brands but so far they're performing well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Love this particular packaging arrangement. I think 48-count is the way to go in the future.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon's batteries are great. I've had no problems with them leaking or corroding.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I just love Amazon's batteries. They last just as long as the name brand batteries, but are much less expensive."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Great batteries. So why not 5 stars I haven't used them long enough yet to know their life expectancy, and it would have been more convenient to have the packaging to be resealable or with fewer in the same container. I ordered 20 and it came in two 10-pack sealed plastic things. Not a big deal, since I took care when opening them. All remotes and appliances that I've inserted the new batteries into are still working perfectly after a month. That's all I ask."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Not so surprised as AmazonBasics delivers excellent product. Work just like the Energizers and last as long.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Everything we have around the house uses batteries, so we go through them fast. I like purchasing in bulk because I don't have to purchase them as often and they are a little cheaper that way. I was a little nervous to purchase the AmazonBasics brand, because I wanted to make sure that I purchased a quality battery. We normally purchase Duracell.I am happy to see that the quality is just as good as the other brands we've purchase and at a fraction of the cost.We will be purchasing these again in the future."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I thought I would give these AA batteries a try. I have always used Kirkland brand and never had a problem. These are a few cents cheaper. I will see how long they last compared to Kirkland brand (Costco).

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,AmazonBasics are a tremendous deal. I bought this 36 count AAA because it cost about the same as 4 pack of name brand. If ever I give an electronic gift I include these with the gift.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've been impressed with the performance and quality of AmazonBasics battery. Though the price point is pretty low, don't let that fool you - they are every bit as long-lasting and durable as the brand-named batteries on the market.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I purchased this product for my own use, and Ive found it to be a great product. Size, fit, quality and the whole mess is top notch. I have to admit I was a little hesitant at first, given the price, but after opening the box I immediately realized I had made a good purchase.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries and even better price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These seem to work / last like any other quality battery. Packaged well. Great price.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is like my fifth box of these batteries and they last as long if not longer than any others I've purchased, including the copper top and the bunny.All Amazon products from their basics to their electronics can't be beat. Very BIG fan of Amazon branded products. The only thing I don't buy from Amazon is perishable foods. Man would I love to see one od their food stores in Santa Fe!"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,AOK-AS ORDERED
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good. I usually buy Duracell, but I trust amazon... sooooo I tried these. No complaints thus far"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries rock. They have one of the best performance to price ratio's anywhere. We use large numbers of them to power microphone transmitter packs in our theater productions. Those are applications where they cannot fail. These outperformed the ProCells we have been using. I recently bought 900 of them for our production of the Wizard of OZ. They worked flawlessly. They are our new standard battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are dead. Low expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Run of the mill batteries, for the price and convenience, especially with Prime shipping, are a good buy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,arrived and worked like a charm!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries arrived in a timely manner. I was in need of a battery for my wireless mouse and after Alexa placed y order this package arrived in record time to my door.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Product as advertised. Arrived on time and in good condition. Good value! Will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Average value in quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As always...reliable and well packaged.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As described
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Received the batteries as they were described. So far the ones I have tried have worked great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries came exactly as described. I have only used a couple of them and they work great in the remote..Time will tell about shelf life...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,AA they work
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,as expected
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,As expected.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"As expected from Amazon, there were no problems with the ordering and delivery process. So far I have installed several batteries, but it's too soon to tell how long they are going to last."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,As expected. Batteries at a good price. Batteries come in a brown box. Inside the batteries are in groups of 4.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,As expected. Nothing special.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,GREAT VALUE
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I work in an electronics lab and did a test against the big name batteries and the discharge curve and performance was exactly the same as the brand that stars with E !!! Very good value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They seem just as good as any I have bought from the store. I have used them for countless things and have had no problems. They came on time and it is great to have the convenience of delivery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I bought these batteries being skeptical about their price and quality - since when were store brand batteries ever really good and worth the cost Well Amazon will surprise you again with another great addition to AmazonBasics. These batteries are as good as if not better than major name brands. I have been using these batteries in devices that typical run down alkaline batteries in a couple of weeks, and so far these batteries have lasted twice as long. I have not noticed any problems or differences with these batteries, and I have yet to test them with my voltmeter for consistency however, I have noticed no issues or problems. I usually prefer to use rechargeable batteries, but these make using alkaline batteries worth it again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was skeptical at first, but these AmazonBasics batteries are pretty competitive to Duracell and Energizer alkaline batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The Amazon batteries seems to have an acceptably long life compared to much more expensive brand names. My one complaint is that they recently upsized the box the smaller package was much more convenient to store the batteries in.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,you can't go wrong with this. quality is as good as brand name products.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,as good as costco
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love these batteries from Amazon and will continue to buy them for my controllers for gaming as they are strong enough to deal with them. I get a long life from these. As long as I do from my Duracells! I complete this review after either I or an immediate family member has tested the product thoroughly. Sometimes I have very little to say about a product if it works and it does what it is advertised. Sometimes I wax effusive, or rather poetic. Either way please be assured that we have tested the product and have been honest with you. If my review is helpful for you or makes sense, please indicate Yes below. Thank you for reading my review."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As it should be...AAA Alkaline battery. Can't beat the price and quality. Holds up well to its competitors. This is a no brainer if you like to save money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love Amazon basics batteries. They last a long time and are cheap. Plus the packaging is convenient.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work as well as any standard-type batteries on the market. They last just as long as the name brand batteries. I don't know how well they store because I have been giving a lot to kids who had inferior batteries in their handhelds. I ran out that way. They use those handhelds constantly, but they haven't had to replace any of the batteries I gave them (it's been a couple of months). Other devices have had these batteries for six months, now, and are going strong."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price and they seem to last as long as name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are just as good as any other battery as far as I can tell but cost far less. Great option if you use lots of batteries! Tired of the store ripping me off when I need a couple.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Was worried these might be low quality, but they have performed about as well as premium brand batteries. Will reorder when more are needed. Can't comment on leak resistance yet, but everything else seems top notch."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"As good as the brand name batteries at considerably less cost. I have tried numerous off brand batteries in the past. None of them have ever lasted as long as the name brands, and some were almost dead right out of the box. I have found these batteries to last just as well as the name brand batteries, in both the AA and AAA sizes. I have not tried the D or C cells yet."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Bargain of the year. Have already used a dozen for various electronic items and they are, so far, performing as well as the name brands If I find they quit too soon I will update the review"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As good or better than any major brand out there.The price is a fraction of what the major brands are.Time will tell what the durability is.This proves what a rip off battery prices are from the major brand manufacturers.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"As a Mom of 3 young kids, we go through batteries very quick! I've tried all types of batteries from name brand, to various store brands. Amazon compares to the top brands I've used, and in fact I would consider it a top brand. They last twice as long in my son's wireless PlayStation controllers than the Toys R Us brand we were previously using. You can't beat the price for the quality and I will only buy Amazon batteries from now on!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have used these batteries for several years. As good, if not better than any other top name brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As if Amazon had to be any better at anything else. These batteries are great. I was skeptical but you can't beat the price and they last a long time. Must have if you have kids and their toys that require a lot of batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries kick ass. Just as good as name brand. Would purchase again!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Price per battery is great. I checked the voltage on some of them and they were all at 1.6V. I think they will last at least as long as the brand name batteries, although I wouldn't be surprised if I were to learn they are all made by the same people and just labeled differently."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great !!!A lot of batteries.Last long and don't leak.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Lotta batteries. at a good price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"At least half of this batch had no charge, or at least so little that they died within an hour of being put in a walkie-talkie. Very disappointed"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries work better than the ones I recharge. So I'll probably buy batteries in bulk instead of recharging from now on. I'll still need to buy rechargeables for my solar devices.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Its works perfectly for me in many of my devices. So I like this.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These were OK. I don't think I'll but them in the future. I prefer Energizers.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Last about 8 hours of non stop use which is about average. But the price was AMAZING!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Decent battery, but seem to change them out a little bit faster than the big name batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These batteries won't last long. An led flashlight will drain them in a hurry. I usually like Amazon products but this is one to avoid.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,A lot of batteries for a good price! Came on time!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are a no brainer. They work great and the price can't be beat.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Awesome
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great deal, packaging and shipped in a timely manner."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great scotts that's a lot of batteries and definitely a life saving price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"just as expected, awesome service"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Outlast name brand batteries. This is a great product.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works great just like the expensive brands
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Yay! The best price and great quality
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love Amazon Batteries. This is the first time I have tried the Performance line. So far so Great :)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I thought theses would be crap like the typical cheapo batteries. But to my delight they are actually pretty decent quality. They do not last as long as I would like but for the price I can not complain.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Love love these batteries, great value"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon Basics - you are my hero. These are great batteries. I use them in my Apple keyboard and mouse and they have outlasted the brandname batteries I used to use. I get on average an additional 1-2 weeks of use out of each set of batteries which is an additional money saver. The shelf life seems to be normal for alkaline batteries.The packaging is biodegradable which adds to the convenience and value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail about these batteries. Other reviewers here have done a fantastic job of doing that. Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are by far the best value for your money while getting good quality batteries! I will never purchase another brand again. Purchasing these only costs a few dollars more than a small pack of batteries at Walmart but you're getting a lot more and stocking up. I have noticed absolutely no difference between the Amazon basics and the name brands like Duracell, Energizer, etc. I highly recommend these batteries"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These are good batteries. How do I know. I installed these in my electric tooth brush 2 months ago. The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are a great deal! The price is very reasonable and the life of the batteries are just as good as any major brand. Now that I have tried these out, I will purchase the amazon brand for all my future battery needs."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is actually the second or third time I have ordered these and by that evidence it should be obvious that I really love the quality and value of these batteries. I have bought the crappy ones from the dollar store but they seriously don't last. Not worries with these bad boys! I don't need to replace them anymore often than the name brand . If this review helped you, click YES below. Thank you!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love these batteries. I am so happy that I bought them. Batteries are super expensive at my local retailer. It's sad when the batteries cost more than the thing you are putting them into. I paid about the same amount to get 48... Yes 48 AA batteries from Amazon as I would have paid to get 8 from my local retailer. I needed batteries for my new game trail camera. It takes 8 AA batteries and I was fearful that I was going to go into the poor house trying to keep fresh batteries in my trail camera. I went shopping online at Amazon and found these. I bought these several weeks ago. I used 8 AA from this box in my new trail camera. I am so happy with them. My trail camera has been in the woods several weeks and the batteries are still over 90 charged and that's after taking tons of video of game. These are working great and I saved a ton of cash. I am buying a box of the AAA now. I always seem to need them around the house for some reason. I am very happy with my new batteries from AmazonBasics. They are working great for me. I hope you found this information useful to you and thank you for reading.If you found this information helpful please click Yes on the link below. I greatly appreciate it.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Ordering more. What's that tell you
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What a deal! Awesome now I always have plenty of batteries at home. Also this was a very good value for the money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love these batt's! Long life! works great in toys all other items!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Awesome for cold/iced drinks! Keeps ice cubes from melting fast. Love this product! I wish they have a set for each design though.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They seem to be holding up just as well as the top battery brands, for a fraction of the cost! Another great product from AmazonBasics-I will be hunting for their other products now!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"awesome price for decent batteries. they hold up fairly well, haven't run them through any rigorous tests, but when I put them in the remote control it seems to work again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Awesome price, awesome batteries. I will never buy batteries anywhere else again, this deal is hard to beat."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are what you expect. They work. Price is awesome
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Tried these for the first time last night. Played indoor with my wife and 12 and 6 year old daughters. Awesome time! Beats sitting around the table playing a board game. I will check back in the Spring to see if they are still working. So far, I highly recommend."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great money saver! will repurchase when i get near running out.these are great to have on hand (especially when it always seems that you need new batteries for everything at the same time).
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Awesome value for the price! I haven't had a single problem with these batteries and I've used them in remotes, cameras, toys, all kinds of stuff. I'll never buy batteries from the store again!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Boom-Shacka-Lacka-Lacka! Great price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for a great price. They last just as long as the name brand batteries do.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've bought these before. They used to have a different design, but with the new design comes longer life! I love these, especially for the price. Definitely last as long as the name brands!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We love these batteries! Better pricing than the bigger brands, but work just as well and just as long! Go Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Everything came as described and fast delivery (:
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Still running strong after I had a string of battery-operated lights on for a whole week (in 8-hour shifts of darkness).
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work very well! Thank you for making a battery at a reasonable price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Not good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I've been using these on my roku remote and the lifespan is terrible. About two weeks, when Duracell's have been 1-2 months"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Awful poor performance. My mouse ran for several weeks to several months from Duracells but have never gotten more that several days from these. Will not buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Well, these are basic, average, ordinary non-rechargeable AA batteries. You get 100 in bundles of 4 tightly wrapped in plastic, all packaged in a plain corrugated cardboard box. The price is good. The batteries are plentiful. I've read reviewer complaints here that the battery quality is inferior, that they don't work, or explode, or ooze, or don't last very long. I can't tell you about this. I don't have a battery tester and nor do I have the ambition to set up a test involving these vs. some top brands to see which work better and last longer.Don't try to charge them (duh!) and just use them. I'm not a big user of AA batteries and now that the World As I Knew It is coming to an end, there will probably be plenty of these still in my house when that end arrives."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries do not hold charge well. By the time I need to use it few weeks none of them work
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"BAD BATCH NOT LASTING!Have been using these for the Roku Remote, and they are dying after just a few days of use.Have been happy with Amazon battery purchases in the past.Not sure if the quality is overall lower than it once was, or if this was just a bad batch."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,They for really fast
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Some of the four packs (02-2027) are bad upon first use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Theses did not work. Wanted to make sure I had batteries for the item I was purchasing but they did not work. I had to dig some out of my junk drawer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Wrong item.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"They last a day in an xbox controller, if you're lucky"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Many of the batteries are no good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"For the price a great value, will never buy another overpriced brand name battery again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Fantastic bargain and holding up well months later. I go through a lot of batteries, like almost everyone nowadays. So I searched for a better deal. I think I found it here. A big savings over grocery store batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good price and good batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great deal. I go through these like water through a sieve. USB mouse, flashlights, etc."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works great and seems to last as long as my other batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,A lot of batteries for a little money. What more could you want
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"good bargain. haven't had them long enough to determine life, but so far so good!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great bargain.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I more than recommend this purchase. I encourage it. The batteries work great. A bargain at the price and how many you get. I won't be buying batteries anywhere else again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries at a good price. They do the job. I've moved almost everything to AAs and need to keep disposables for hurricane season (no power for weeks) These are just right.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good amount of battery for the price.But they are not as long lasting as Duracell
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Basic AA batteries for a good price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Easy decision, the amazon basics line of products has always worked well for me, and amazon customer service on their stuff is amazing if you need it.There is little difference in Alkaline batteries. (Costco hits top rank in consumer reports, but I have not seen their amazon battery rating.)But ordering from amazon is so easy, and the quality is good"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries at a great value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The box is actually quite nice for storage. It is flat, and easy to open."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"What we expected, a bargain battery, so we are happy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Using my el cheapo multimeter (Fluke was at work) all batteries were well within the my device's tolerance for reading resting voltage and internal resistance. No duds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapper in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name brands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charger, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,A nice bunch of batteries that work exactly as supposed to. Basics indeed!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Are batteries. Do work. Yay.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Like all of Amazon's products, these work well."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Lots of energy !!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love these batteries. Not only do I not have to go to the store for batteries but they seem to last longer then most of the batteries I have bought in the store. We use alot of batteries between my boys and their toys but also for cordless mics since my husband is a DJ. The big test that won me over was when you do toasts at weddings and announcements. We are able to use a set of batteries for more then one wedding
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Love these, I go through the batteries so nice to get more for my money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice flat packaging. They work for a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Pretty sure these batteries are way better the name brand batteries! Don't get sacked into name brand when you can get just the same from the amazon store a

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They are batteries, what can I say. Bought as gifts to go along with the candles."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are batteries... They do last a while though in the R/C toys we got for x-mas. I would buy these again over more expensive name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They make things work!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work well

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Pros: Good batteries. I like the easy subscription option which helps make them even cheaper. Packaging is nicely done.Con: Found them cheaper.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are awesome!! They are cost effective and last just as long as Energizer or Duracell. I have used these in both low drain (toys and small electronics) as well as high drain devices (Cameras and high powered LED flashlights). Using the Subscribe and Save makes them even more cost effective.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are batteries. These seem to work fine and the price was right.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I looked at the average rating of the major battery brands (EverReady, Duracell, Rayovac , etc). they all rate the same as these. Same complaints from the one and two star raters. I conclude batteries are batteries. So, I bought these and I've been happy with them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far so good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries. They make small devices work. What more is there to say
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are batteries are batteries. These are good. Last as long as they should. Came quickly.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Batteries are batteries these seemed fine for us! They lasted the whole Taylor Swift concert! Don't really know how long they last total.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Batteries are great, price isn't the best. I've seen similar packs of generic batteries for cheaper. Wegmans comes to mind.."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Batteries are great.....I need them for my work for my camera for taking pictures on the job of properties. Nice to have extras on hand at an affordable price. I don't see that they last any less time than the name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I used these batteries in a Canon 420 Speedflash. Normally, under multiple exposure (around 3 shots per second), using standard alkaline I'd get 3 continuous flashes before a miss, or with fancy High Discharge Rate Flash batteries (translate - Expensive!), I'd get 5-6 continuous flashes. The last photography shoot, I was asked to get back-to-back images of a person at a surprise Birthday Party. Imagine my surprise when, upon entry of the victim, I captured 9 continuous exposures with perfect flash! I am very impressed!These batteries are high quality and surprisingly powerful!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Price can't be beat...batteries aren't great, but they're so cheap"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries work as promised. So far they seem to last and have not had any issues. Our kids blow though lots of batteries and for the price these are a must have.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I don't have any little kids , however the big boys seem to ear these batteries just as quickly. Price was great. Satisfied our' needs."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're normal batteries, I just love that I could order them online and have them shipped with the wireless mouse I ordered the same day and have them arrive at the same time!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,good part is that they give you a lot of them. bad part is they die way too quickly.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I have two Macs, each with their own wireless mac keyboards. I used these batteries in both keyboards and each worked great for several days. My desk keyboard failed to connect last week so I attempted to replace the batteries, but they had expanded inside the keyboard and will not come out. I assumed it was a chance happening. But now my wireless keyboard at my downstairs computer just failed. The batteries have expanded inside that keyboard as well and will not come out. Amazon refunded us for the batteries but now we need to replace the two keyboards the batteries ruined."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fabulous price! And the batteries work great! I'll be buying all my batteries on Amazon from now on.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Same price to buy all these as it is to buy an 8pack at the store. Why pay more They same to have a similar lifespan. I haven't noticed any difference.When I retire in 30 years I'll probably buy an other case to get me through my last years. But these should last until then.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Are you like me! Do you have 46 devices in your home and they all seem to use AA! Amazon batteries are great quality super inexpensive and easy to get! It never fails that you need one or two batteries at 9 am or 9 pm and don't want the hassle of getting in the car for that 20 minute (or more) round trip to the drug store. A must have on the list of things worth having delivered to the house!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"So far, so good. They are what they are supposed to be. I will check back after using and see if they have long life. BTW, packaging is very good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What's to say They're batteries and they're from Amazon. Just another staple item you'll need at a great price. Why shop anywhere else
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"hey, they're batteries. They do what they are suppose to do."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love that it comes in a box. So smart for batteries. You don't have a lot of loose batteries like you do once you open a blister pack.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great product at a great price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Beware these batteries - I just packed them up for returning hated to have to do so but they lasted only 5 hours in tiny flashlights for my grand kids !!! Big disappointment too - won't buy this brand batteries again...nor do I recommend them to anyone out there !
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Just purchased in October and replaced the batteries in my camping lantern this past week using these. The batteries leaked inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether. I attempted to clean the contacts and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaked that the plastic and internals have a permanent coat of oxidation on it. Had to buy a new lantern. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I was excited to see that Amazon was allowing its name to be used on batteries as I feel that Amazon is concerned about its image. Bought these batteries and placed four of them into my camera. Took 2 RAW photos and the batteries are now dead. What a disappointment.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Batteries ok ok , but a fan of their packaging."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon rocks. Great batteries at the click of a button lol!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I don't think I will ever go back to Costco to buy batteries. The price is awesome for the quantity and they last just as long as name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries seem fine. Hard to tell if they are as good as name brand until I use them for a while.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I haven't had these batteries long enough to tell you if they last a long time or not but for the price you can't go wrong and I trust the Amazon basic batteries to be a better value than buying Energizer or Duracell batteries online that might come from a seller who is knocking them off from China
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,packaged per 4 they seem fine
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Batteries seem to last a good amount of time. Good value. Much better than going to a wholesale place and ending up with a pack where 50 of them don't work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Came as advertised. Batteries seem to last pretty long and the price was great. Even the paging they sent it in was greatPlease Vote YES on my review!! Thank you
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Batteries seem to work fine but they are packaged in multiples of 4 and it's an annoyance to break open a new pack each time. What's the point in buying in bulk with so much packaging
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These seem to last just fine for games and toys. Great value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I tested each of these batteries and they were indeed batteries. Would buy again!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great Batteries. Love the performance and value. With all our remotes and other battery demands this batteries will do the trick.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Difficult to be excited about AA batteries but everything about the purchase was as advertised. They were well packaged and even arrived several days early. They are working well. My regret is that I did not order AAA batteries at the same time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries that work. Seem to last the same as other major brands, but cheaper to buy. A no-brainer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,None of first eight batteries I opened worked. Tested other batteries to confirm was a battery problem. Confirmed!!!Wow.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries were packaged good and seem fine
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries where used in mt solar light actually work well! Amazon could sell rechargeable that is some thing I'm very interested! I use a lot during summer and winter!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far these batteries are perfect. I put a fresh set in my electric toothbrush and thought my teeth were going to buzz out of their sockets. Not really, but they do seem to have more 'juice' than the national brands, if that is possible."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We like them
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"We have been using these batteries in some kids toys and they work fine. I haven't noticed them lasting longer or shorter than others. We normally purchase the Kirkland brand one from Costco, and these appear to be equivalent. Its great to have a large supply of batteries on hand when you have kids!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries work fine and are less expensive then all of the others on Amazon for sell. Nothing more to say!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,batteries work great for my xbox controller. I get the same amount of time as any other brand I have bought.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work great! First time I ordered them, but they were a great price. I love ordering from Amazon and hate getting out of the house so I will continue to order these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Batteries work perfectly. Only problem is the packaging is a little large. You will need to put them in a smaller container unless u have a ton of cupboard space.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries worked great at a reasonable price. I used them in an xbox one controller, which can eat up batteries, and received similar battery life to more expensive name brand batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries, nuff said."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Just started using this pack, and so far they've lasted as long as any leading brand battery. The price is also fair, for the amount that they offer you."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Yup, a bunch of batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Always needing AA for toys. Include in my subscribe save for convenience. Seems to be a quality battery and up to par with other brand name batteries. Will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are functional batteries. Nothing really special aside from being Amazon branded
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Anything from Amazon Basics is AMAZONG.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries! So far no problem with any I've received, they do the job!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good product at great price!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Average batteries, functioning as expected, at a great price. I think I'll see if they've got some AA's at a comparable price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,As expected
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries. I'm not really sure what to write here. They were packaged safely. They arrived. They power the little LED lights I bought on amazon. Yay batteries! I can't speak to how long they last because who actually pays attention to that I'm using them to power little tap lights.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are batteries....
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're batteries, they work. I'll post about it I see they don't last very long, but I've gained a lot of trust in Amazon brand products so I'm fairly confident."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries for cheap!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries...what can you say
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Living in a remote control world like I do I use a pretty fair amount of batteries, I find that these Amazon brand batteries are just as good or better than the copper top, or energizer, the price is competitive with the other brands , Kirkland, acdelco, rayovac, the preform really well in all devices, and the shelf life is great, I would recommend highly,"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is a real Bargain folks get'um while you can...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I change the batteries at least once a month. These things eat batteries like crazy and are hardly used.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Breaks down too fast and won't run my trail camera but around 6 hours.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Trust Amazon Basics products. Work like the top name brand products, but at a greatly reduced price. Use these in my bike lights."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,My remote wouldn't work so I took out my batteries and noticed the end of one of these batteries leaked all along one side of my remote.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Leaked all over our lantern battery case. I purchased these batteries for an emergency since they had a long shelf life. I put 4 batteries into each of my lanterns and 2 each into my flashlights. I have multiple battery leaks between the lanterns and flashlights. I ended up spending over an hour cleaning up the battery cases and flashlights. I've purchased the AAA pack as well and don't seem to have the same problem.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These batteries did their job but did not last very long at all. At the time of writing this I used them about two months. Normally that would be good, but I only was using them in a set of LED string lights that I kept on at most an hour a day. In the past month I barely used them at all, because the batteries had started to die and alter the color of the lights. I had expected to get a lot longer use out of them, considering other brands I only need to change every six months at earliest."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I've had several of these 'fail' long before they should have. Several instances of having to replace them much sooner that competitors batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,This item arrived with no battery pack. There is no way to power the toy without it because you can't just use regular batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"You know, I really like the Amazon line of batteries. At first I has hesitant on using anything other than Duracell, I tried these and especially for the price you simply cannot go wrong...."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Battery replenishment
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Easy to order easy to keep a reoccurring order if you tend use batteries often. I don't notice a difference between this brand or a more popular branch in terms of durability. We keep them on hand at our house because you never know when you'll need one or four of them. I'll be ordering them again soon.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great buy
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are the best! I love amazon branded items!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Durable, long lasting, ordering again !"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're batteries, they work that is all"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"My bluetooth mouse and keyboard eat batteries, so I liked the idea of a big pack that I could just leave in my desk. These batteries are pretty woeful, though, lasting only about 1/2 as long as the Duracells I get in the grocery store."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Be Careful with this one - I put 4 of these into my TV remote and almost immediately had one pop. I could hear a sizzling sound within the remote and I immediately took out the battery carrier (I inserted them in proper polarity). One of the batteries was actually fizzling at the female end where it had split and was leaking. Unreal.... I've never had a battery do this before. I will NOT be ordering these ever again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I installed three of these beautiful AAA cells into my bike light. Now I believe that I am less likely to die in a violent crash with a car.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,High quality and quite decorative. Highly recommended.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Been happy with Amazon batteries. Dont' see much difference vs the duracell that I usually buy. So now, i just the the amazon. This is the 3rd set that I have bought. They are so cheap that I give them with gifts. The parents and kids love me because they usually don't' have batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Been using Amazon Basics batteries for awhile now. Very inexpensive way to keep extra batteries around all the time. We go through a lot of double and triple A batteries. Do they last as long as name brand I don't know but at least I can afford to have twice as many around for the same money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Bunch of AA batteries. Been working fine. Seems to be a good value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Being a gamer I go through batteries quite frequently. I do have rechargeable battery packs but I often forget to plug them in and I am too impatient to wait to play until after they are charged. These batteries have surprised me with how long they last in my XBox 360 Controllers!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"i am ready to do a full review on this product.Sins the package arrived in my house, i immediately take 2 aa battery and put it to my mac mouse,believe me mac mouse is 24/7 in use and it got me thru for 1 month and 1 week FEB / 19 - MAR / 25-26really good product"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon brand just as good as big name brands and way cheaper. Never buying another brand again!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I prefer purchasing my batteries in bulk, so that I can buy them once and forget about them for the upcoming months (or year). AmazonBasics was, at the time of purchase, the most economical pack of AAA batteries.I haven't noticed any difference in time or quality of use. I don't use AAA batteries for many things, though, and for those that I do the items tend to last for quite some time on a pair of batteries, so I would not notice a change unless the batteries were really, really poor quality. Thankfully, they're not, and their price point made them a steal for me. These also store well - I have had no issues using some of these that my parents purchased years ago and they appear comparable to the pack I purchased recently.I've lately been really impressed with the quality of electronics that AmazonBasics offers. As store-brands go, this is among the first that has yet to disappoint me!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These Amazon AA batteries are better than other leading brands like Duracell or Energizer compared within the Alkaline category. I'm happy that I bought these as they are described as advertised. They last long and do not leak that nasty white stuff when you leave your batteries in a device for an extremely long time. I'm not sure about shelf life though as I never put aside a battery for that many years and tried it before, but I do believe these can last way longer than the other brands. From experience, I feel that these out last longer than others with normal usage. The shiny coating looks better than the white coat before. The price for a pack of these is also the best value than going to any actual store to buy them as they tend to be expensive. So far, every one of these batteries worked just fine with full charges and no dead ones at all. Very satisfied and happy I made this purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Best product from amazon basics,packaging is super good and easy to use"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for a awesome price. Could not ask for more.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They last longer then I thought they would.Seeing how cheap they are.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent value. Been using in all electronics and no complaints.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just as good as Duracells for a fraction of the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just an amazing product how can you go wrong.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can not beat this deal anywhere. These batteries were just as good as the top brand batteries my husband always buys... if you are running through batteries all the time because of kids toys (which was my case) this will be a good deal for you! BUY IT!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"BEST BATTERIES EVERSeriously, way better than the two big brands that I have been buying for years.My insulin pump goes through one of these every 1.5 months were an energizer battery lasts .75 months"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"12 for a 48 pack. Very long lasting batteries. Just can't beat such a deal..Usually I would have something negative to say about a product, but I have nothing for this."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought these for my Xbox one remotes because the other brands I would buy dies way too quickly. I was a little skeptical at first because I had never heard of Amazon Basics but I'm glad I tried them. I play the Xbox everyday and the batteries have not died within three weeks. That's great quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are by far less expensive and better than any AA or AAA battery and a lot less expensive.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Wow!!!! I bought this sick to the wall light for a closet and it was dim really dim, even with rayovac brand new it was brighter but not impressive. Upon trying these out I was blinded by how bright it was. Box also works nicely to keep batteries in one place."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I'll admit I was a bit worried when buying these because of the price, but they have held up and last a longtime. I highly recommend over the overpriced big brand batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I got these for my grandkids toys and just got them cause they were cheap and would deliver. Well I was wrong! They been playing with their toys since Christmas and the batteries are still going strong. So my recommendation these are the ones to buy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These test full charge while the ones i have been buying are already partially discharged bc u cannot tell how fresh they r, even when they are adv as good for 10 yrs."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Another great product from amazon. I also use their rechargeable AA batteries which last a lot longer than any Energizer or Duracell that I have ever used. When it comes to any common battery size (AA, AAA, C, D, etc.), I will only be using AmazonBasics. Give this product a try and you won't be disappointed. You can't beat the price and/or quality."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love the price... now I never run out of batteries... and they last just a long as other batteries I have purchased.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Best value on batteries yet and surprisingly long lasting, high quality batteries by Amazon. Will buy more when needed."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best price and easy to order. I only buy Amazon Basics batteries now.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can't find a better deal
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best buy for your money
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Lasting power....I use them in a TENS unit. They work well enough as any. 27 cents per battery, I wasnt really expecting them to work so well but I was surprised."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can't beat this deal!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Best battery deal out there, And they work just as good as the name brands like Duracell."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Ever since getting an insulin pump, I've been using more AAA batteries since my pump uses them. I was happy to find that AmazonBasics offers AAA batteries at a bargain price so that I don't have to spend more money keeping myself alive. Type 1 diabetes is expensive in itself and I'm glad that I can save, even if it's just spare change, on the products I need to purchase to keep my insulin pump going. I find that these last just as long as name-brand batteries and have had no problems with them. In the future I will be using Amazon's Subscribe Save program now that I know how long the batteries in my insulin pump last. Overall, I would recommend these batteries if you regularly use AAA batteries and like to save money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Trusted brand, good price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought these for my wireless Apple mouse and keyboard that eat through batteries quick. They seem to last me just as long as Energizer and Duracell AA batteries at a fraction of the cost.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work as good as Duracel and cost less. Not much else to say.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are the bomb. They work just as well as top brands (Energizer, Duracell) and are like half the price. They shipped super fast and there are so many that I still have some lying around from my order last year. Definitely will re-order when I run out. :)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best deal you can find for AA's. And the Xbox controllers last for days with them. Just like a brand name battery!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best deal. Great quality batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"OMG! these batteries are so affordable! And it may just be my biased opinion, but they seem to last longer than the Duracell or Energizer batteries I buy at the store (maybe because they don't sit in inventory for goodness know how long). Regardless, these are my favorite AAs"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The battery were pack in a plastic solid thing holding the battery inside of a very well made box. I have not tested the battery but the Do Not list is well thought out. It Has it in English,Chinse,Spanish,Dutch,French and One Other. This has to be why you should buy AmazonBasics battery instead of other people cause their prices higher than in stores for a cheap medium grade battery. I a real person and feel free to ask the oddest question.AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (8-Pack) - Packaging May Vary"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great product, long lasting with a great price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love AmazonBasics in general and this number of batteries at that price- you cannot even beat that at the dollar store even with their crappy low quality batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good batteries. Love them
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I like that these were wrapped in plastic in sets of 4 to help keep them organized. These worked well and restocked my battery storage area. The box was simple and compact, no larger than it had to be - this is never the case at big box stores. Thanks, Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries. I don't think they last nearly as long as some of the bigger name brands. But can not be beat for price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"long lasting and powerful. also, best pricing."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I have purchased Amazon batteries before and they last as long as the leading brands like Energizer or Duracell's for 3x less the cost. Most people nowadays are using rechargeable but there are a few things that still require Alkaline such as my temp signal transmitter for my digital clocks and a pair of these lasted about 9 months out in weather. Other brands died within a few months. You will not be disappointed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I put these in a Pumpkin candle for Halloween and they lasted 4 days. I put them in a Flameless candle set of 5 and they lasted one week set on a timer to go on for 5 hours a night. These are really not economical. Best to pay the price for the good ones.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We normally buy CostCo batteries, so we don't by the Top brand anyway. It's a question of value. If the top brand lasts to a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the best, longest lasting, battery life, and these only last to a 7 or 8 they are a great value anyway because they are 100 batteries for 22. That's just 0.22 per battery. Twenty-Two cents vs about 46 cents for the top brand is a pretty good deal in my book.Okay I might have to change batteries more often which I see is the only downside.Again it's all about value to me. These AmazonBasics AAA batteries are a bargain."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Everyone needs extra batteries around the house. These Amazon Basics AA are in every control that I have in my home. As far as I can tell they last as long as the expensive main brands. Get a box of batteries, throw them in 'that' drawer, and never run out of batteries again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are great, and a real value when you buy in bulk. I would highly advise you to buy more then you need because the higher you go the bigger discount you get. They come shipped in very good packaging, and packed tight to keep them safe. If you buy many the packaging can be used for safe storage.The performance of these batteries is about what you would come to expect from Amazon. They on on par with more expensive Energizer brand batteries. The shelf life on these is also around 10 years. While I'm a big advocate for lithium batteries, sometimes you just need a less expensive option and these are always my goto brand. You will be hard pressed to find a better value for your money in terms of batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"It seemed like everything I bought for my daughter required 12 batteries a piece! This is a great value. Now all her swings, bouncers, and toys are fully operational. I've purchased this size and others. No issues and will buy all my batteries from Amazon from now on."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I looked at the math about the capacity and strength and longevity of different batteries and a lot of them are similar, including these, and these make the most sense price wise.I have tried HUNDREDS of rechargeable batteries and they get recharged a couple of times and then disappear. At a certain point they are just a waste of money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best value I've ever gotten on batteries. They last as long as a Duracell at about 1/8 the price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is the best deal I've found for batteries. Now I can always have plenty on hand. The simple packaging is a plus over store bought blister packed batteries too.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best value in batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are awesome. They're an amazing value - buying Amazon batteries in bulk is the best deal I've found anywhere. And the subscribe and save option is awesome when you have kids in the house - gadgets and remotes and games and controllers and toys, oh my! This keeps you ready and stocked.I also like the way they're packaged - plastic wrap is easy to tear off, but holds together sets of 4, all boxed together. Very handy.These are a must for any busy, budget-conscious parent!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It's probably the best value for AA batteries out there. They function as expected.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon Basics batteries are my go-to favorites. I've tried several different sizes they've all functioned perfectly. We go through a lot of AAA batteries for electronics like trackballs and remote controls these seem to be the most reliable and longest-lasting I've found. Love the price the high quality. A terrifc value. Most highly recommended!--Have a question about these batteries Just leave a comment I'll be happy to help you, if I can."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best bang for your buck. All the batteries last as long as leading brands for a fraction of the cost. We've got 3 kids and we go through batteries like crazy over here. I cannot even begin to tell you how much money these Amazon batteries have saved us! Thanks!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,LOVE these! They last a long time and you can't beat the price! Great value!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"What I found was that in our Wii controllers and Xbox controllers, the rechargeable packs would die after a few months (maybe last a year)...but then I would have spent so much on the packs that I wouldn't want to replace them, so they would stay in the charger longer and longer and when we wanted to play a game, we only got 10 minutes of play time until the rechargeable pack was dead.Then I bought batteries at Walmart (Duracell) and used those...but it was so long between changes that when we wanted to play a game 6 months later, only half the controllers worked! And I was out of batteries!Then I got an Amazon Dash button for these and now all that is gone. I put the box of batteries downstairs by the Xbox and Wii. No more dead batteries!!!! The batteries are in bundles of 4. When we get low, I'll just order another box. Best way to always keep batteries available for controllers, remotes, and such."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The s e area great for all of the times you need this size of battery. The box they come in makes easier to find them in my grab all drawer.Just purchased my second orders onthese
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Better performance than I expected. I feel like I get just as much out of these as the name brands and the price is fantastic. Highly recommend!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seems to be equal to any other brand of batteries I have used.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work as well as any batteries purchased in a brick-and-mortar store. The best part is that they cost less.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries have lasted just as long as any name brand batteries that I have bought. Will continue to buy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Last a long time!!! Better than competing brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,decent quality battery strength for price. better than dollar store for sure
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I believe this one is more better than Duracell. Will buy again .
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good value and better than Duracell, Eveready in my opinion, especially over rated Duracell."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I used to use Duracells all the time, and then started having leakage problems with them. I ventured out to try these. Life seems to be as long in devices I use a lot, and they don't leak. I am done with Duracell, and will use these!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am highly satisfied with these batteries. I mainly use them with Bose noise cancelling headphones and haven't experienced any issues. They last longer than most batteries I have purchases and are much cheaper than competitor brands. A well deserved 5 star rating!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Hold up really well in my son's toys, better than most so far and last a few days in my hubby's Xbox controller, but mind you the thing is hardly ever not in his hands so that's actually a pretty good span compared to others we've used."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries have great life span. Highly recommend. They last just as long if not longer than the top name brands at a much cheaper cost.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love Amazon Basics! They are low cost, well made, and quality checked. Better than name brand. Only place to get cheaper well made batteries is maybe Costo and no buddy got time for that! :) ha!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries are great! They work well and the price point can't be beat. I especially love that these come on my subscribe and save order and I no longer pay for batteries at the check out counter in the grocery store.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I personally think that these batteries are as good as name brand ones for half the price! I primarily use these in my xbox one controllers and change batteries maybe twice a month of heavy play. Definitely worth the purchase!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love that Amazon offers its own brand of products for an amazing price! These batteries work just as well as any other brand I've purchased from the store, if not better. I have a remote control that eats through batteries (it also powers headphones so I don't disturb my boyfriend while he's trying to sleep) and so far these have lasted longer than the Duracell batteries I've been using. They were a better deal as well! I've already recommended these to my family and friends with children who always complain that all their kids toys requires batteries. I will be buying more!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,need these!!! better than other bateries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We are having good luck with these batteries. The ones we used previously that came from the box store whose name begins with a C, have been known to leak acid in multiple applications, and so far these have been super in both AA and AAA sizes. Super pricing too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These appear to work better than Rayovacs. I only use Energizer/Duracell for smoke/CO2 detectors.In some kids toys, these have out performed Rayovacs, however, one sale, Rayovacs tend to be cheaper. I will continue to order these, especially out of convience, most likely on Subscribe and Save."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries. Can't beat the price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I usually only buy Duracell batteries that I purchase on sale through Groupon. I received a bad batch and it always takes so long to get them that I decided to give the Amazon batteries a try. I'll never buy another battery anywhere else. Thank you Amazon for providing another quality product that worked as well as the most expensive brands out there at a reduced price. Shipping was prompt and on time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon Basics batteries are the best, I use them specifically in my Kwikset KEVO among other things. Certain items that were burning through batteries very quickly are now out of mind for 2 months +"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Well packaged with the full rated voltage and then some.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've gone through so many batteries with the BlinkforHome cameras, far more than they say it should. I've spent a fortune on big brand batteries and the lifespan was awful. Someone suggested I try AmazonBasics and so far I've only need four batteries in the time that I would have used 20 or more. When I use up the AAA size I have sitting around I'll get a box of those too in the AmazonBasics brand. These are superior to Duracell in every way."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"No joke, i was such a skeptic of these batteries. Seriously. But they seem more powerful than the name brand competition.I bought them for use in a breast pump mainly. I noticed with other batteries I was getting a lot less suction but with these it runs full power, just like I'd plugged it in the wall.I don't think I'll buy the name brand batteries anymore. Good job Amazon."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Long lasting and a great value! Come in very basic packaging, most likely to cut cost. Will buy again!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seems to work better and last longer in our flashlights then the name brands!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,tested these batteries along side name brand in a handheld microphone and they actually preformed better and lasted longer then the big name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Longer lasting battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Had these in my wii for 2 weeks and the batteries leaked all over.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. If this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable brands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Sorry to say these batteries leaked in a lighted mirror and ruined it. C'mon, Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have quickly become a fan of Amazon Basics products. You just can't beat the price and quality. These batteries run just as long as the Duracell's I had before this purchase. I bought these based on the reviews and because the price was so good. I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Wireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic wireless mice), TV remotes and clocks. So far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried. I keep them on a shelf in a rough room in my basement to keep them cool and dry. The do come wrapped in 4's in the box. That keeps them organized nicely in the box, but the wrapper can be a frustration so I keep a razor knife on the same shelf which make very quick work of that. Problem solved. Overall, I am totally satisfied and as I said, I will buying more of the Amazon Basics as they become available."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,A good value but I'm still using them so don't know how long they will last. To be continued
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Super batteries, they last long. Package has so many units that I'm sharing with family and friends. If it's Amazon you know is good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,My family goes through a lot of AA and AAA batteries. I've been buying bulk packs of AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline Batteries for a few years now and my household expenditures on batteries have gone down by nearly half. I don't see any difference in the overall performance or life of these batteries when compared to Duracell or EverReady alkaline batteries and they cost quite a bit less.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These perform and last just as well as Energizer or Duracell. We burn through these at my office for wireless keyboards and mice, so I needed to restock at a good price. I've never had any complaints by anything made by AmazonBasics at all. These come in a simple cardboard box that's sealed. Inside that box, you have two rows of sealed/wrapped batteries. They worked great for my needs, and will return based on the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good, I'll try and let folks know if they don't last as long as branded batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Bought these for my sisters day care. She said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Bought these for the holidays and I have to say I am impressed. I thought for the price I couldn't go wrong but these things hold their charge compared to any name brand. Kids have been running them in their toys non stop and they keep on going. I will definitely not hesitate to buy amazon batteries ever again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"As advertised, a box of 36 AAA batteries. I have a bunch in my kitchen already, from when I bought a box (36) of Duracell AAA batteries last January. Well, I guess you can never have too many. A better deal here (Amazon) than the Duracell box, hope they perform as well too. Time will tell, have a great day."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I'm no battery expert, but based upon using these in the same devices that I've used name brand batteries, I notice no difference in performance. Notably, when I used them in a recording wrist pulse oximeter, the amount of time that these lasted was identical to all other brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are good batteries. How do I know. I installed these in my electric tooth brush 2 months ago. The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Brand new and packaged inside box 4-in a row. Batteries last just as long if not more than name brand for much higher price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent idea to buy together!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries have performed just as well as name brand batteries, and the price was very reasonable."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I now have five times as many batteries as when I buy them at the grocery store, for the same price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,what a good deal on batteries they work well
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I purchased these a little more than skeptical about how long these would actually last. But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through. So I said why not and bought them. They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and gadgets require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surpised I was with these. They come in a card board box which is was nice and easy to store. The batteries are wrapped up into groups of 4's. They hold a fairly long charge so you don't have to change them out too often.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Simple packaging. No frills. It just works. These are standard batteries and will last as long as any others you'll find, but at a MUCH better price than any store will have."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Not the longest lasting. But good for the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Don't last very long, but hey they are super cheap"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I bought these batteries because I have had leakage problems with name branded batteries. These batteries were cheaperand seem to work well. I won't know if they leak until some time goes by,but I have had good luck with the unbrandedbatteries I purchased from Amazon in the past."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I never use amazon batteries before,but I love it, It's good for the price,it last just as long as duracell batteries, and the design of the batteries is just cute"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Pros: You can get a LOT of batteries for a very cheap price!Cons: Batteries do not last very long at ALL!I don't mind changing out batteries on something I use constantly since I got the hundred back, but it can get a little annoying doing it once a week. I bought these specifically for my XBox One controller which is used daily for an hour or two on average."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"For some reason, they are not working very well with my wireless mouse. Mouse pointer mover very slowly when I use these batteries, but it works fine when I use different batteries"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Still evaluating, but just bought some more because they work well with my applications and their price is the best."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Haven't use it, but looks good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I bought these mainly for my headphones I listen to tv with in bed at night to avoid disturbing my husband. Will last about a week in those. I sometimes forget to turn them off. Haven't timed them or anything, but no particular difference noted between these and higher priced brand name batteries--are noticeably better than some more inexpensive ones I have bought in a pinch. Also use in bathroom scales (weigh daily) and food scales (used daily), and last a long time. Love convenience of not running out of batteries frequently."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Not sure how long these last yet, but seem fine so far. I like the box they come in that is strong, but then they put hard plastic wrap on 4 packs of the battery that are a pain to remove. Get out your knife, don't cut yourself."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was sick and tired of my duracells leaking so I bought these. Only one month in, so it's hard to know if they leak, but so far so good. No complaints."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They last nearly as long as name brand, but the price is amazing. Never buying other batteries again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Non name brand batteries usually freak me out a little, but these actually work pretty well. I drain batteries pretty fast, and so far these hold up like Duracell."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Fast shipping. I haven't worn out one yet, so I dont know what their life will be, but they look good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Took awhile to get here, but they seem fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Nothing really special, but they work just fine and aren't too expensive."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I love Amazon. I am a prime member. Have had an amazon credit card for 16 years. Think their service and pricing is second to none.But.... these batteries are garbage. Gar-bage.They really don't work or at the very least don't work most of the time. Even when they do appear to work they only last like 1/4 of the time a normal AA would. Maybe you can justify the pricing for certain situations.Should you use them for led string lights and hope they last a couple months Yep.Portable defribrilator No.RC car Sure.Camera for younger sister's wedding in the Greek Isles Nope.Vibrating nose hair trimmer Ok.Computer battery for your 17 hour flight to Siberia Nyet.Get my drift... sure try them out, and keep trying them, like I have, but don't put any faith in them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These are the WORST batteries I have ever encountered anywhere in my 46-year life! I am appalled that Amazon put their name on them I guarantee that if these had been my first Amazon purchase, I would never have done business here again. If they had not been wrapped in packs of 4 batteries in cellophane, I would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to Amazon.None of the batteries was anywhere close to full power - they couldn't provide adequate power to anything I tried them in for any battery-powered item to work properly. Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. None of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Every item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I'm sure I would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them. I am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any battery-powered device!!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"This set of batteries exploded being stored in my garage, right next to a set of duracell. Duracell is fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great for the price but don't last long but the quantity makes up for it
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These last about a week.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price! Batteries work great. I'm happy that I bought in bulk because I saved money and now I'm not constantly searching for batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,BUY THE BEST OR SUFFER LIKE THE REST
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,your basic batteries but cheaper. Did not notice shorter life span. Great for college
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Not good. Don't last a week.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Awesome purchase. Last a pretty long time!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,they are fresh batteries and work great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for super price! I am on recurring shipment - get a box once a month.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Long lasting and great packaging. Rechargeable is best but these are good in a pinch.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Hands down better than the top brands. Thank you Amazon.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Always buy!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great value for the money. While I cannot compare this to any other batteries lifespan, they have been going for about a month strong now in frequently used devices."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,love the little box it comes in and easy to open. works just like other batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,The ones that work work fine however I've just had to toss eight because they're dead. don't work. not happy
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These are wretched batteries. They typically last only two weeks in a TV remote control device, they can't power a computer's mouse beyond a week, and I have serious doubts about their shelf life. Packaging is nice, though, sort of like The Washington Post."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Bad investment. Some of the batteries did not even work - no juice in them. Really surprised by the poor quality, Amazon Basics."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Terrible batteries!! They exploded all over my face. Received them on a Monday and that Sunday was having problems with my remote so I opened it up and was sprayed in the face with acid. Luckily it missed my eye. I have bought cheap batteries before and never had anything like this happen before!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"From experience, the worst batteries I've ever purchased. Not sure if these were manufactured second hand but more than half of the pack died within ONE USE. As a new mom who depends on the quality and longevity of a good battery for her child's needs, I will never order this product ever again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,A real pleasure.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"When I think of all of the money that I've spent so far on batteries, I am actually a bit furious! I buy batteries for all sorts of things for my family. And to think, these batteries were here all along, and I should've bought them along time ago! Amazon basics batteries are definitely worth the buy! not only do you get the size that you need when you need it, you get enough in a simple package that meets the demands that you need, easier open, and, worth the price! For the same amount of batteries that you get even in the smaller package, you would pay quite a bit more for the larger more popular brands that are out there. These batteries perform just like the others!These of been tested in everything from small toys, two Xbox controllers. Please do not die unexplainably or unexpectedly and they just plain work!I'm ordering a larger package I think but the Subscribe and Save option is great for monthly restocking or a staple item used all the time!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Came in with a nice little package. And the batteries are high quality. I am using these for my string lights that are powered by batteries. Everything seems pretty good so far.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These aren't the greatest batteries but they work. We've found that they work best in computer accessories like a keyboard or mouse but do not last long in things like toy remote controlled cars. Anything that takes a big drain in short bursts off of them (like electric toy car motors) shortens the life of these batteries fast but things that only use a small amount of energy over a long period of time do a lot better. Some name brand batteries do very well with high drain electronics and last a lot longer than these but if you use these Amazon batteries on low draw electronics you'll get your money's worth.What I've found them good for: Keyboard, mouse, laser pointer, small LED flashlights, small noise making toys (plays music, electronic beeps)Not good for: Anything with an electric motor, toy cars, pencil sharpener, etc...They can be a good value depending on what you use them to power."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Only a good price when on sale. I can buy the same amount at Manards for 2 less not on sale
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Best Product Value , Amazon know what they doing (:Good price for quantity , for sure will buy more ."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work just fine.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"There are too many kids toys to count in our house that require batteries. You cannot beat the price of Amazon branded batteries. They last just as long as any other top brand, but a much better value. AmazonBasics has quickly become a brand I trust."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Can't beat em. For the price and quality they are the best.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"You cannot beat the quality for the price of these batteries. For the same price as the cheapo brands, these AmazonBasics batteries are great quality. Nice weight to them compared to the cheap Sony or Sunbeam batteries. Performance wise they have been good so far and been using about a dozen of them for a month now."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Honestly, they are AAA batteries. I had a keyboard that only takes AAA and don't have rechargeable ones. So far, haven't had an issue. Whether or not they last as long as name brand is yet to be seen. But the fact that I bought these already a few months ago and I'm currently typing on said keyboard with the first set I took from package tells me they should last long enough."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"High quality, long lasting, fast delivery. And a great price. Can't beat that! I recommend buying in bulk."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Not the longest lasting but the price more than makes up for it. We're big fans of the Amazon brand batteries in all sizes.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I've had these AA Amazon batteries for a month now and I've had no issues. I replaced the batteries in many of my sons toys when I first got them and all of the toys are still going strong.This pack of batteries comes with 48 AA batteries. It comes in a nice box which I'm still using to keep the unused ones in for storage. I think that the value of these are much better than any other brand. At Walmart for a 24 pack of energizer you will pay 9.94 and for a 24 pack of Duracell you will pay 13.97. This comes with double the amount! With a kid I've learned I can spend a fortune on batteries with all the toys that do not include batteries so I will continue to use these. Very happy with them so far!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price for a ton of batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good buy hands down
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Price per battery this is tough to beat. Performance/longevity wise, these beat out most every generic battery I've used and keeps up with the big brands too. You can't go wrong with these - especially if you have a household with kids ... kids have this magic that makes batteries deplete just by being around them .... lol"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Can't beat the value!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great basic alkaline batteries at a terrific price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great quality batteries. For this many batteries you'd have to pay twice this price if it was name brand. This is a no brainer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent batteries for the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Really excellent value here. They ship in a nice little box that's easy to store, within the box, the batteries are separated into plastic-wrapped packs of 4."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice affordable pack of batteries. I provide photos of what the packaging looks like.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,can't say they are the best batteries in the market. but considering the price!!! Other batteries with the same price would be much worse than this brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I use these for my son's Thomas and friends trains, and they didn't last very long. Maybe 2 days at the most. Won't be ordering these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Cant beat the price, and these batteries seem to last forever even with heavy use. I grabbed this multi pack because you never know when you'll need AAA's and they've come in handy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The power is yours!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Got the juice, delivered right to the house, not a dud in the box."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Works for me however jury is still out on how long these wilol last.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Always provide enough power for the toys. We reorder them when we start getting low.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value on amazon basic batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are top quality and you can't beat the price. If your in the market for batts then amazon basics are for you.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This was an amazing deal very, very, very happy!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price. Good Quality. No complaints.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great option for all the little doo-dads and junk that doesn't need much power. I use these in TV remotes and such.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"What can I say. They are cheap and last as long as the copper top brand name. Don't waste your money on the brand, get the cheaper which is probably made by the brand anyways."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheap and functional. Can't ask for much more.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Cheap and good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheap and convenient! Work great and last just as long as others!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries worked perfectly and last pretty well. And they're cheap. Score!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Probably should have rated these one star, but I didn't because I like Amazon as a whole. These batteries are soooo bad though! They were comparable to the Kirkland ones at Costco in price so I decided to switch things up and try these out. Huge mistake. These last half the life of Kirkland's. Not kidding. Not worth it. These are cheap!!!!!!!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Always worked well in my tools and controllers. Cheap. Dont forget to recycle
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheap and Super convenient
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Only 3 worked out of the entire pack.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The few batteries I have used so far work and are holding up. Will update if they fail prematurely
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've been ordering these cheap batteries for years for my XBOX controllers. They are cheap and long lasting, and I'll never go back to picking up batteries at the store again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,cheap and work gritty good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They're batteries. They're cheaper than Wal-Mart. What more could you want I don't have stats on whether they last longer than Duracell or Energizer, but at this price I don't think it really matters. The brand Amazon Basics has tons of useful stuff all the way from batteries to laptop bags and more. It seems like Amazon wasn't enough of a household name so they're trying to make it so everything in your house has the Amazon name on it, but I ain't mad let them take over. I just wish they had an Amazon Basics brand for disposable diapers."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries..
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"They sure wore out quick! We normally go thru about a dozen AAA batteries in a year. We use them most for TV remotes and wireless mouses. But we replacing these every month. I was quite amazed at how quickly they were wearing out! I have a battery checker and once they hit yellow, they were done.Cheap batteries but I would not recommend nor will I buy again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seems decent as far as life of the batteries. Good enough to stock up on these for emergencies.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These run down in my TV remote quicker than any battery I have used. TV says low battery within a week of installing. I will try another brand next time. Amazon, please keep an eye on quality and have your manufacturer test and give you results periodically. They will often provide good samples for evaluation early in production and then lower quality later."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheaper but still work well :)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works just as well as any other batteries just much cheaper!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Amazon brand batteries are very poor quality. Don't last more than 3 months in a remote control (which barely uses any power). This is shameful and stupid as it diminishes confidence in the Amazon brand name.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,still working fine
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Product was worth the price and more
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I spoil my cats rotten with toys. They burn through AA bats like a lonely middle aged woman. This is the cheapest way to get them. I just wish they didn't plastic wrap them in bundles of 4.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,they don't last as long but they're cheap
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Cheap, long lasting batteries. Can't beat it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great deal! These batteries last just as long as any other brand I've tried, and buying them in bulk is a great deal."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,cheaper and better than branded
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I always order amazon product. Cheaper and good quality
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'm very happy with these batteries. Cheaper than a local deal at a hardware store. They seem to work as well as the name brands. I'm happy with the quality and quantity.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries seem to work just as well as name brand batteries but at a much cheaper price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just as great as name-brand batteries! The only difference seems to be the labels.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I'll keep this relatively brief. I use rechargeable, mainly Eneloop batteries for almost everything. Every once in awhile though I have something that doesn't need the more expensive batteries or are exposed to rougher conditions like remotes or outside hose timers where I just want something disposable. These work well for that. I would buy them again"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love the batteries! The duration of the batteries are pretty long and each one is created the same. Quality is good and above all else is the Price!Cheaper batteries if you buy the 100 pack and way way cheaper than costco!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The price is cheaper that the other famous brands. It works just as great as the other ones. Since when Amazon started selling their brand's battery I am a fan1 of it. I buy AA and AAA. I truly recommend this brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Very nice looking in picture and from a distance but the clock itself is cheaply made....The actual clock mechanism stopped working twice and doesn't work at all now.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Real good, Worked as soon as I put them in. But made in China. not the USA. Trump 2016."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work just as well as the name-brands, come in easy to access packaging, and are a great value! Will never buy batteries from a big box store again!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Comes in a box that is convenient for storing. High quality batteries and not high quality prices.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The positive cap is just a little shorter than it's supposed to be. That means battery holders which have shoulders built into them, the positive terminal doesn't touch the contact. The Chinese find creative ways to cut corners to achieve the desired price point of the customer. They do not sacrifice profit...they sacrifice quality...they sacrifice quantity and they sacrifice material. Thanks China!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Comparable in quality to the more expensive brands. No issues so far with the quality of this batteries. I will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've used Amazon batteries for a couple of years in everything from remotes, toys, flashlights, noise cancelling headsets, and portable games and have been very pleased. They have not let me down yet. The performance is comparable to what you get out of the leading major brands at a fraction of the price. You can save even more if you add these to your Subscribe Save items! You can't beet the price! I highly recommend them!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These batteries held up about as well as dollar store batteries. Very disappointed in quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,First time user seems comparable to EverReady
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I am a big fan of Amazon batteries! They cost less, last as long, and get here in 2 days with Prime!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I've used 4 of these batteries now and the life appears to be comparable with that of Duracell/Energizer. The cost savings over the mainstream brands makes these a real winner! Would buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Lasts just as long as Duracell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Compared to dollar store like batteries these seem to be better but not like twice as good. For the price and quantity it's worth the purchase.Use them in tv remotes to chess computers to kids toys and can't complain. Amazing how many items require AA batteries today.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price. Compares well to major brands
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Does the job. Seems to have good life. One complaint is that the batteries are in sealed groups of 4 which complicates opening them. A simple box of 48 loose would be much easier to deal with.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"OK for general use, fairly cheap, esp compared to lithium. Consumer Reports lists Kirkland from Cosco as better performers and about the same price. I'm gonna try them next. Of course being delivered to your door in a hurry is always great."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Something as simple as a pack of batteries brought to you by Amazon at a more than competitive price delivered to your door. How could you go wrong
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I like how easy and fast it is to order these batteries. This is a really good price for the convenience aspect.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,great price and now I have them on hand whenever I may need a battery!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Well, I've only used 3 of these for about an hour but they are lovely so far."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This battery pack is economical, and the convenience of having it delivered is a plus."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheap and easy batteries in an easy open package that is also recyclable and good for storage. Perfect for those toys (child and adult toys) that are constantly using batteries. I wish Amazon offered a package with prepaid return postage for recycling. I would pay an extra dollar or something if I could pack them back in the box and ship them back to Amazon for recycling. YOU HEAR THAT AMAZON
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're batteries, what more do I need to say"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Stopped working in less than 3 months.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries work as good as any other big brand
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far these batteries perform as well as any other alkaline battery that I have used. The cost even beats Duracell at Costco so I consider it a good deal.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It seems to work as good as Brand name batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Do not last as long as costco/kirkland equivalents.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These batteries seem to not last as long as other batteries I have used. They feel like they're made of good material, but they don't last as long as I would like them to."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,couldn't be happier. They work great and appear to have a long life.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon Basics. That's all that needs to be said:)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don't waste your money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Love this when I'm doing my makeup. it was a lot larger than I expected which I really loved! The only con I found is that it is TOO BRIGHT. When I first used it, my eyes and head hurt because of the brightness. But overall, this is a great product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Crazy cheap. They last about as long as name brand batteries in my Xbox controllers, TV remote, and my expansive AmazonBasics adult toy collection. What more needs to be said"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"DO NOT PURCHASE! These batteries leaked in a machine I was using in my kids room to project stars on the ceiling. When I picked the projector up, it leaked battery fluid on me and burned my arms and legs. It could have gotten on my children! The leaking fluid also ruined the projector.The batteries were new, stored at room temp, used at room temp, not recharged, and not exposed to any fluid or abnormal conditions. Disposing in the appropriate manner.ETA: I was VERY happy with Amazon's resolution despite this bad experience. Thanks Amazon... I'll order batteries from you again. Just not your brand..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"If you, like me, dont care what batteries you use in your TV remote these are fine for youPros-Um 100 batteriesThey come in packs of 4, so not loose batteries rolling aroundCons-I hear they may drain quicker than more expensive batteries. To that I say: I have 99 more where that came from."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"With four kids under the roof, their toys are always in need of AA batteries. I had purchased this AmazonBasics pack of AA batteries for exactly that purpose. The expiration year reads 2024, but after just two years of sitting on the shelf, the batteries that are left are all but dead. They weren't left in cold storage to freeze, they were right on the shelf in our living room. I ended-up going to Radio Shack and purchasing one of their batteries instead.I can only imagine that most of the 5-star reviews for this product are based off initial impressions and short-term use. It's really sad that they just can't hold their own after only two years. Will stick with known brands from now on."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Bought a box of 36 aaa batteries and all batteries were dead. Don't waste your money. The only way I rated it 1one star is because it would not except ZERO stars which is what this product deserves.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,None of these batteries had a full charge. My charge detector never reached the green zone. They were one half used up. This was true for the other two sizes D and AAA.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,All the batteries came dead. None of them worked. Don't bother buying these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I got two of these batteries with my Fire TV stick. Loaded them in and everything was good for 1.5 days. Then the Fire TV stick stopped responding. I trouble shooted with no fix. Called customer service and they had me trouble shoot too, started by saying can you change the batteries.... my response ... seriously, you want me to change the batteries, it's a freaking TV stick what could possibly be wrong, the batteries are brand new and came with the device. So I was changing the batteries as I was saying all that only for the new batteries to fix the problem. So.... these amazon batteries died in 1.5 days. How does that happen"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,It's seems as thought all of the batteries in the package are already dead. They are only lasting 3-4 days in the devices I'm putting them in. Fairly disappointed
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The batteries were not operable out of the package. Thought it was the appliance, but replaced with other batteries and it worked fine. Luckily, Amazon's return policy is amazing but I doubt I'll try another one of their Basics brand items anytime soon."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries don't last as long as the top brands, but for the price I can't complain too much."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These work pretty well. They don't seem to last quite as long as Duracell or Energizer, but for the price I will continue to buy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,decent batteries. doesnt seem to last as long as better brands. use it for xbox 1 controller.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,decent batteries. ok life.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Decent batteries for a great price, idk if they last as long as energizer but so far so good, I will order more for Christmas for sure."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"It's now about the middle of April and I bought these at the end of February, I waited to post my review so I could get a better feel for these and how they last and how they compare to other batteries I've been using.We use a lot of batteries in our house so I buy bulk and these seemed like a good deal and they were or are.These seem to last just as long as other batteries I've used in terms of usage time so no complaints there at all. I'm happy with them for sure, will purchase again as needed."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Decent batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They don't last that long but, since you get so many, it doesn't matter that much."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Amazon Batteries! They got me on the price, but how's the performance! Honestly I can't tell cause who's counting I usually by pro cells because Sometimes I'm a pro. Just kidding but really i work in entertainment so we use pro cells but I bought a box of these just to keep handy and save the day when pro cells are not available. These really aren't that bad. Pro TIP: Make sure you dispose them properly so you don't kill the earth. I'd definitely buy these again. Now that I am a father, there's all kinda of other things to put batteries in. Also do not skimp out on your earthquake kit. It sounds like whatever but honestly you need to prepare folks!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I bought these solely based on price. (Might have even been a Prime Day special, I'm not positive at this point)Use them in remotes, my camera flash, and a few flashlights. I think they work just fine and last an appropriate amount of time. If it seems they were used up quickly, I just think about the price I paid and have no issues."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are okay by me.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seems to have lifespan of other name brand batteries. Happy with them
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They dont last as long as certain premium brands but they do OK. I wouldnt put them in critical apps like smoke detectors but for TV remotes and toys and all the other goofy modern distractions that regularly beg for AAs they are OK.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They're a decent value for the amount of batteries (especially on Prime Day) you get. I use them mainly in remotes around the house and other devices, and I haven't had any issues with them leaking. They do drain a little faster than Duracell coppertops, but these are a far better value when caught on sale. I've used both the AA and AAA and they're both decent."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Not the best, not the worst. Less life than some batteries but price is right."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far hasn't been bad but there have been a few batteries with really low life span.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Decided to try these private labeled batteries and they work excellently. I have already purchased more of a different size.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Defective and cheap. Only a third held any charge and those died super fast.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Defective! All Amazon batteries I tried over the past year have been defectlve. Most too short. I have to constantly pull the spring, if the device has the spring, and roll the battery around to get it to work again. These are new batteries. Many of the batteries were thrown away because we thought they had been used up. It wasn't until recently that we realized it was all the Amazon batteries that were causing the problem. I was on the phone with Amazon for two hours yesterday trying to get these orders straighten that out. I still have no confirmation that I do not have to send the batteries back because many went into the trash."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I am now trying to use the batteries and basically they are not working. Perhaps they are old, but they are just plain not working. I put in a Duracell and my headphones work. I put any one of the 36 batteries in the headphones - and it is not working. It is not worth the effort to get my 10 back."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The price is fantastic and they work just as well as certain name brand batteries with the copper top and the bunny.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"AAA batteries. They make things go. I, uh...I have nothing else. I mean, batteries are pretty much--Oh, wait! They're quite shiny also."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'll never buy Dollar Store batteries again! D They're great. I'd put them on par with Energizer or Duracell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can not beat the price and it is by a trusted name.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great product at a great price! I have been using these alongside the more name-brand batteries, and so far they are still neck and neck! I'm always looking for a quality product at a great price, and I really feel like these have the longevity to do that. I'm very pleased, and we will be buying Amazon batteries as our household battery moving forward."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good value and dependable
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries are usually a good buy for the money. I have had leakage on one occasion and dead cells a couple of times, but overall I have been satisfied. I think these batteries are as good as any other on the market."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. ."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Batteries dead as of June 1. I did not use half of then. Good for 6 months.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"We used in an August smart lock. We expected to get about 2-3 months of use based on the energizer batteries that came with the lock, but batteries died in 2 weeks."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I bought these for remotes in my home. I'm constantly having to change them and sometimes the brand new batteries don't work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I used these in wireless microphones in church. They didn't last as long as I expected. Actually, rechargeable batteries do nearly as well."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Ive gone thru half the box. Everyone of these batteries lasted for about 10 minutes and then died. Not happy at all! Wasted money on something i needed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you'd be better off buying a quality brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These batteries die out a lot faster than the Duracell batteries we normally purchase. Yes, they are cheaper, but unfortunately more batteries are ending up in the landfills because we are going through these too fast."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"They didn't last long, do not waste your money!! Die quickly, most of them didn't even work out of the package!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Hi ordered these thinking they were a great price, but sadly they die very quickly."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,these batteries died very quickly when compared to energizer or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,run out super quick! would not buy again
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Holds basically a 30 minute steady usage charge and dies. We used these in microphones, and they died within the 30-40 minute range, fully charged.It also seems that the older they get, the longer it takes to charge and the faster they die out. Not very reliable, unfortunately."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Cheap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Amazn brand again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Disappointed by the amount of time these batteries lasted.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Do not hold charge as well as major brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I love Amazon, but these aren't at the same level as the big brands. I use them in some monitoring devices in my home. Typically I would need to change these every 3 months, but these are lasting about 6-7 weeks at best. They're ok, but just don't have the life expectancy I need."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,these batteries are terrible very disappointed. i have purchased before great long lasting very powerful. i must have received a bad batch they don't last very long. i may not purchase again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Worked for one day, then stopped working. Can't tell if it deterred any cats because it only went off when I walked by, but didn't register the cats when they jumped on the counter.Would not recommend."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Disappointed with this product. Used them for led candles and had to wiggle them around to get them to work. At the same time I also purchase ACDelco Batteries because Amazon would only allow the purchase of one box. I'm glad I did because the ACDelco batteries worked great! I would not purchase AmazonBasics batteries again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Batteries are notably less long-lived compared to other brands. Disappointed!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,The price was right but they just don't last as long as the other name brand batteries so it's not worth it.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Sadly these batteries are horrible! I hardly ever have complaints about anything I order but these batteries barely have any power and I've had to change them out many times.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries literally only last 15 minutes inside of each device I put them in. When I researched the product, they told me the only way was to spend 50 on the recharger for these batteries. I personally do not buy batteries to have to spend more than what I spent on them in whole to have to buy a whole other product to recharge them. Worst amazon product I ever wasted my money on"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries were a huge disappointment. I used two in my amazon tv remote and they lasted only 2 weeks. Usually, I only need to change batteries in that remote every 3-4 months or so. Total ripoff."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"For some reason, these just haven't held a charge the way the Duracells I've used the past do. I've used these in those small-wired-LED lights you can use for decorations. Those lights take 3 AA batteries and while the old Duracells I've used lasted several months on a 4-hour on, 16 hour-off timer, these are lasting just a few weeks."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries are not lasting at all.... very short life on them... super disappointed...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Batteries don't last that long I bought these for some of the little round lights that go in your closets or under your cabinets they didn't make it a week which was sad.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Spend a few more dollars and get a branded one. These discharge very fast. Had to keep changing my wall clock battery every 2 months when I had these. Got an energizer battery and that stayed for more than a year. Didn't expect amazon product to be of such poor quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Bought several times and they last
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great Batteries. Cost and shipping was well worth it.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"DO NOT BUY. All batteries arrived completely dead. I thought it might be a bad batch. Ordered more, all arrived dead."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I only have it one star because I couldn't give zero stars. Over half of the box were dead. The ones that did work, only worked for a very short time. Do not buy these batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,They didn't work. Took one from each pack and - nothing!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Went to pit them on for the first time and the strap behind the buckle broke. Never even got to wear them. Poor construction, cheaply made product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,You get what you pay for.Lucky to get 2 weeks of minimum use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,They went Dead before even using them.. The ones i used lasted maybe 4hours at best !!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Might as well be dead on arrival. Already burned through two sets of 4 of these since I ordered them less than two months ago on a Schlage keypad deadbolt lock. The previous batteries lasted over a year. I'll never order another Amazon basics battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Purchased these 3 months ago in addition to a higher end () brand that came with a 9 docket charger. The higher end rechargeables are still going strong. These leaked battery acid all over my charger and ruined one docket, and ruined an under cabinet puck light. Save your money! They won't last!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Bought these batteries thinking they were a good price. I have two deodorizer devices that spray a tiny amount every :20 minutes. I put these batteries in one and a brand name in the other. The name brand batteries have not been changed yet ant these batteries have gone through 4 pairs. Name brand are cheaper in the long run
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Do not have issues with their batteries and definitely cheaper than the regular store, the only other store that compares is Ikea."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I don't understand why these are rated so highly - these batteries DO NOT LAST. I have never experienced batteries that died so quickly....I used them from everything to my computer mouse to microphone and they lasted maybe about 1/4 the time of what I'm used to. I guess you get what you pay for - would never order these again
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,They do not last long at all. I have to keep changing them out on the products I put them in. Will not be buying them again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,batteries last a fraction of the time that most of the other well known battery brands do
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I ordered a ton of these for holiday candle lights. They are in for 6 hours each night and turn off on a timer. We are 15 days in and every single candle (34 of them) is so dim you can barely see them.Expected to get far more life out of these. Do not recommend.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,They do not work. I had to buy Duracell
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries started leaking right out of the box.I threw them in the trash and went back to Duracell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Medium durability. Gonna buy Duracell in future. Do you have great quality rechargeables
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Because paying 20-40 dollars at Walmart (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right If you are like me and have 3 kids that all have annoying gizmos and electronic crap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer. I have not tested these with my joule thief to see how long they can last. But I'd say on par with the others.This may sound dorky-- when batteries are this cheap, you will find yourself putting them back into toys, remotes, electronics that you had previously marked as not necessary to be powered."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. What a disappointment. Threw them away. :(
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Literally the worst battery I've ever had. I've used them in different types of products and they are DEAD WITHIN A WEEK every time. Go to the dollar tree and save yourself some money and a headache
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far so good. Let's see how they hold up over time. Hope they hold their charge and don't leak.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They are ok batteries. I use them on my remotes and have to switch out frequently.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Does not last. Very short life span.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries last a decent amount for things like toys and remotes. The packages come 4 each in a plastic wrap so you don't have to worry about loose batteries floating around after you open the box.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I didn't conduct an official experiment, but they seem to work just as good as any other batteries out there. Perfect!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Does the job. Very good price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good price good batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are batteries so what can one say. ...they are economical and function. I bought light motion that require 3 AAA batteries. I needed 9 and they all work flawlessly. Plus now my remote control also works too.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,After one use in a regular used battery powered item it's dead. With other brand I can use the item several times before I have to replace the battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I was really excited to find a great deal on batteries. I would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls. And basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down. I could not believe how many batteries I went through for a child's toy. These batteries don't hold there ground against brand name. I burnt through 24 amazon batteries in one month on my son's hot wheel course. Just basic use maybe an hour a day at most. Brand name has lasted 2 months.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These die SO fast.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Put these batteries in led string lights on two wreaths, place kirkland batteries in another set of the same lights....guess what Amazon batteries loose their power quickly. Kirkland batteries are still flashing strong,,,,,,Amazon batteries barely blink. Sorry Amazon, love you but not these for me."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,doesn't work with everything. baby toys good. electronics not so much
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,It doesn't work with my Amazon wireless mouse
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works for the purpose purchased.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value. Keep the power just the same as the much higher priced Duracell and Energizer batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Haven't noticed any difference in performance since I switch from my (brand name), big difference in price though. I will be ordering these from now on."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These go dead very quickly. Not worth it if you rely on whatever the batteries are powering. Maybe ok for a remote control or something unimportant.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Didn't have hardly any charge to them. A total waste of money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries don't even work in a Amazon Firestick!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Don't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Why spend more on other brand name batteries when you can get these for a fraction of the price and they work really well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Worst batteries for photographers. I'm sure they might be fine for using around the house, but for what I purchased them for (using with my external flash) these are the worst batteries I've ever used.Won't purchase them again.The black ones that are supposed to be better are also horrible for photographers.Household use only."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Never put a review online about a purchase , but this Amazon battery leak so badly I have to discard all of them after 2 weeks of use, DON'T BUY THIS ITEM ...."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These are, by, far, the worst batteries my family has ever purchased. They have all lasted less than one week and I've only used them in things that see usage a few times per week. None of them have seen more than 10 min total usage before needing replaced and q about a third of them have leaked or corroded worthiness a few days. I've had much better luck with dollar store brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I use it for the roku remote and it runs out so fast, holds for about 2-3 weeks (just like the chineese batteries),"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"You get what you pay for here. These are cheap batteries and don't last very long, I'd spend the extra and get rechargeables."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I put two of these in my small flashlight and they only lasted about 15 minutes. Waste of money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Don't hold a charge as long as other comparable batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Don't know why I waited so long to finally invest in rechargeable batteries. Once you switch, you won't go back!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Good price but batteries just don't last as long as name brands. My hope was to power Christmas decorations through the holidays and save a few bucks. Many of these batteries did not make it. In the future I will stick with proven brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Terrible. Don't hold their charge, I change the batteries in my remote once a week. Will not be buying again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These are terrible. Don't last Put then in various items and their life is only 1/2 half of a Duracell
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These have failed after a few weeks each time I've used them in my wireless keyboard. Duracells, on the other hand, have lasted for months."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I like that these batteries are cheaper but they don't last as long as I'd like. We will continue to buy them though because of the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Batteries do not last at all. Worth just getting energizer batteries instead.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"After using two sets of these, I am going to agree with other reviewers and say that they don't last as long as name brand batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energizer, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries don't last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries don't last. They might be a good value but for me it's more important to have a battery that lasts longer. Or use these for hiking and rockclimbing and working on my car in the middle the night if I have a flat tire. If you use them like that you want a much better battery like the name brands Duracell, energizer etc. If you just want something that's cheap these batteries are definitely cheap but I bought the 60 count Duracell batteries for .36 each. I think the Amazon ones go for just a bit over .20 each. I think the Duracell's last more than a third longer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Don't look further for any other brand. You get double the amount of batteries for the same price compared to other brands. The battery life is comparable to the other name brands. Must have for every household.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,long lasting/good price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,They lasted less than 24 hours in my mouse and that includes turning the mouse off overnight! What a ripoff.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I bought these batteries to charge my insulin pump - a life critical device. After I started using them, I found my pump worked terribly and after testing all other variables, popped out the Amazon battery and replaced with a Duracell, and everything was back to normal. I won't use these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great value for batteries in bulk - our household expends batteries quickly, so it's great to always have a backup supply.The low cost of these means I can afford to keep plenty on hand. The quality is comparable to most other brands we've tried - especially for video game controllers and the like."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I am very disappointed in these. I put them in my remote and within 24 hrs they are completely dead. For shame, Amazon. For shame."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'm never going to buy a brand-name battery again . Amazon basic batteries are just as good as the big boys . Amazon basic batteries are my battery of choice from now on .
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Won't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detectors with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell. The last Duracell batteries lasted almost 3 years in the same detectors. Don't waste your money on these, spend a little more for a good product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I use a lot of batteries for lighted decorations all year round. I tried these out during Halloween. They were the worst. I tested them against Sams Club batteries, Harbor Freight Tools batteries and duracell. The amazon always died first. They even leaked that battery acid out after a few hours of use. Just horrible. I removed these from my subscribe and save list. I won't buy again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These are horrible! Don't waste your money. These batteries die faster than any I've ever tried. A few hours in a Wii remote and they have to be replaced. I'm so disappointed!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,The original Amazon Basics in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I like shopping with Amazon and have purchased several Amazon brand products. However, I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. I opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking. I threw those away. I need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it, there was no charge in the batteries at all. About half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival. The other ones had a charge but did not last long. Save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else. You will pay more but they work. I tried to return this pack but I was out of the 30 day window to return so I'm out the money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,they dont last long at all not worth buying
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,A Great Deal On Great Batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,dont last as long as I expected them to. they are in our fire stick remotes and i have to change them about every 2 or 3 months
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to recharge them and it leaked all over my battery charger. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. So if I were you, don't charge them"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Exactly what I needed, lots of AA batteries for a cheap price. They last just as long as any other battery so this was totally worth it. Will only buy my batteries from here now on."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries don't last!!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,All but about 4 were duds. What a waste of money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Not very long lasting batteries....
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was surprised to see how inexpensive these batteries were and packaged nice
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These batteries are HYPED! Duracell always wins. I bought them for electronic circuit for my experiments and I can clearly see how they fail against Duracell AAA batteries. I also wonder about the review someone has put that shows the performance plots. Under standard conditions doesn't matter, batteries need to perform the way consumers use them. To be fair, these batteries are better but don't show them as the best in the world, no way!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Considering that Duracell batteries are guaranteed to leak and ruin your device, these are an excellent alternative."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Bought these in late Nov. By March 1, most of them were dead in the package."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works well, easy packaging"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries for days, easy and cheap. If they simply work, I'll be all good. The packaging is shiny, so they will, right :)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The Internet of Things... more like, Internet of Batteries! The more smart gear we get, the more batteries we blow through. When my wifi-enabled scale (!) pooped out after about 9 months on the factory batteries, I restocked it with the Amazon Basics. They ship in a compact, no-frills cardboard box... inside a larger Amazon shipping box. The cardboard box is easy to open... no screwing around with scissors and sharp plastic packaging. Then you can close the lid on them when done and not worry about them rolling everywhere. If you have shaky hands or poor eyesight, these are the ones to get."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Arrived quickly. Easy to install with clear, simple instructions. Touch screen input seems to be the same as it was prior to installation."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works as well as the name brand batteries but so much cheaper! Easy to unpack also.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Plug and play! Easy to use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Would highly recommend. Much cheaper than traditional clam-shell battery packs in store and seem to have a decent shelf life.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We are pleased with these AAA batteries. They are economical and have worked well for us in the items we tried them with. Easy to store in the cardboard box they arrived in.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just as good as the more expensive name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Does not last as long as name brands such as Duracell and Energizer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Cheap and effective, These batteries last a reasonable amount of time for the price"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Such a great deal on efficient batteries. My kids use batteries like crazy on their leap pads . I've tried several store brands and big brand names. These last as well as a Duracell and we're so much better priced.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I gave one star because they were batteries and did not explode in my face which is a major plus. However, if you need batteries for anything you use on a daily basis outside a tv remote then do not buy. These batteries do not last as long as duracell or energizer by far, and i wish i was getting paid to say that. Spend the extra dollars and buy a better battery."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Just enough batteries to fill all the remotes and have a few in reserve.And, hey, it's Amazon - you can't beat the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Dynamic Strong Battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works great and cheaper than at big box stores! We have lots of frameless candles, so these are great"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It's a whole crap load of Aa batteries. They make electricity happen. It's magic
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Their batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,If your looking for batteries of the future that are environmentally safe you need only look for NiZn batteries they put out more power and last much longer and are rechargeable. AGAIN THEY ARE ENVIRONMENTALY SAFE. Check out 1.6volt batteries NiZn.. much better battery then anything out there.!! DO your customers a favor and bring them up to date with new technology.. FACT!!!!!!!!!!PLEASE HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND USE A MUCH BETTER BATTERY NiZn
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work as well as any big name brand batteries. I'm a heavy pc user since I work from home and I use a wireless mouse with my laptop. I can get weeks of use out of these without an issue. And even when the low battery light starts flashing on the mouse, I still get 2-3 days use out of them. Save your money, and buy these instead."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Why people buy batteries at the store any more is beyond me. The price on these can't be beat and they last as long as the name brand batteries. Even better they show up at your door, leaving you do spend time doing things you want to do."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Blown away by the affordability of these batteries. Even if they're slightly subpar in length of useful life, it's STILL a killer deal."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Even though there not bans brand batteries they last a while use two out of the pack and it's still going for about a month
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Every battery had a voltage reading between 1.61 and 1.66v. Will update if the lifespan of these batteries is less than expected.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Ok people. Everyone knows how it is when you've run out of double A's. I added these to my subscribesave. They seem to last a fair amount of time (even in the game boy!). Every household needs a good stache of double A's hidden somewhere. The price is vey affordable too. Great buy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"batteries.. everybody need them.. these are everybit as good as duracell for half the price, better than energizer .... very satisfied I use them for professional audio and photography..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Everyone discusses the pros and cons of batteries. They lasted 1.2 hours less than brand A or .34 hours longer than brand B.Whatever. They're necessary. They're cheaper than some, more expensive than some. if you're buying 300 batteries a week.......Blah blah..... I have these in my flashlights. I have lots of flashlights. I don't have to go to the store. More than enough for a positive rating."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Proper sized (unlike generic batteries) with lots of power.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are sooo much cheaper than the name brands and function the exact same. I use a lot of batteries with my Xbox controller and saw no difference in battery life between these and name brands. Will absolutely buy more in the future
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Exactly as described. I'll learn if they last or not.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Wonderful batteries! These batteries are great and last a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excelent

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent - not sure why I would ever pay more for batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent batteries. Can't complain! A lot cheaper than any other brands and you get the same good quality. Amazon doesn't disappoint.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent set of batteries, very affordable, and comes with a nice packaging. I won't be buying batteries from retail stores anymore."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries and great price. Thanks Amazon (and by the way, if you're listening, please make an entire Amazon Basics store so Prime Members can shop in there exclusively)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price for batteries with exceptional performance and life.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"i now use AA and AAA amazon batteries, great price, same quality as name brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The price is unbeatable! Never buying batteries at CVS agaun
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These Amazon Basic batteries are just as good as the expensive name brand. I'll be buying these from now on.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Unbeatable for the price. Haven't tested in depth, but seem to last just as long as any name brand AA's."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent for the price. I usually buy Duracell for the guys and their video game controllers -- these last just as long and saved us some .. came in a box that was great for storage and batteries were also vacuum packed by 4's inside the cardboard box. Will buy again
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is an excellent phone case. Five star sleek look and perfect fit.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Satisfied will reorder
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They work great and come in excellent packaging!I can't vouch for their lifespan vs the big brands, since I haven't paid attention to how long my old batteries would last. It's at least comparable! Comparable enough that the discount on AmazonBasics batteries is definitely worthwhile!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent Batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good Price, excellent packaging, and the batteries last a long time in comparison with other brand batteries I have tried that only came with four in the pack for the same price! Will order these from now on from Amazon!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries, great price!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price and lasts just as long as leading brands of batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great product for its value. Amazon isn't doing things just because Amazon does things because they are needed by customers and this is just small example of that.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I shouldn't be since it's amazon. But there as good as name brands. I'll buy from now on. Save unselfish money
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Put 4 of these in my handheld scanner 2 weeks ago, still going strong. I normally leave it on between 1 to 3 hours at a time. To say I'm beyond impressed is an understatement. Out of normal alkaline batteries, I was getting at best 2 or 3 days."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Superior to Dura C batteries. I compared new batteries of each brand in the same flashlight. Amazon batteries were brighter.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are done long lasting batteries. They work great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work great!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works as described
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can never have too many batteries. These last a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are most likely made by a third party with some experience in manufacturing private label. They are well made, lasts long (cannot tell significant difference between these and the brand name ones). I also like the convenience of having them shipped to me as I don't relish shopping for batteries at physical stores. Made in Indonesia."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Throw away all my generic batteries and replaced with these. 48-Pack came in a nice carton box with 4-pcs. battery in each plastic wrap. Used in remote controllers, game controllers, mouse, automatic spray air fresheners, LED flashlights and camping lanterns, clocks, wall lamps, and other devices. Excellent batteries for the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,EXCELLENT BATTERIES FOR THE PRICE.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent batteries with a long shelf-life.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent batteries, at a good price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"As good as any of the big name brands. Only complaint is the very difficult to remove plastic from each group of four batteries. I appreciate that Amazon is concerned with reducing package size, but wrapping them in plastic isn't working for me. Would have been much better to use a small band to keep them together since they are in a tight cardboard box, it is unlikely they will short each other out, the band probably isn't even needed."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love the product and the price.Batteries work great. I love that I can keep extras on hand. Batteries come in either brown sturdy box or plastic box.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work great. Inexpensive, and from a name you can trust!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent batteries! Last just as long if not longer than the name brands. These are what I'll be purchasing from now on.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I needed AAA batteries and it's going to be a while before I get to Costco to get some. I was buying something else on Amazon and decided to get some batteries, to give it a chance. They arrived in 2 days, they were well packaged and sealed, and most importantly, they work great, they hold a charge well, I am very pleased. Excellent batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're definitely good batteries! What a bargain. I recommend this if you have a lot of AAA toys.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,AA batteries- good quality can't beat the value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent batteries. Long lasting in small MP3 player.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"using them in our trail cam, excellent battery life"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are your standard AA batteries that are very similar to most other AA batteries you will find at most stores. The energy output is quite similar however the price on Amazon is a lot cheaper than what you can find in the store. For that reason I really like using these batteries from Amazon Basics. They are cheap and they last an acceptable amount of time for a cheap battery.Dimensions and close-ups can be seen in the photos I have attached to the review.Included in this set are 48 batteries that are shrink wrapped in groups of 4.Pros:*Good amount of power output*Last an acceptable amount of time*Awesome priceCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:These batteries are not rechargeable. They are one-time use. If you need a rechargeable battery you will need to look elsewhere.Overall: 5/5 stars (.5 rounds up, .5 rounds down) 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work just as well as the top battery brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent cells for the price range. From what I see, they are as good as Duracells and that is all I ever used to use.The packaging is amazing. Only in China can they still pack in cardboard boxes that surround the package like this.I am not doing any testing, other than use in low powered items like wireless mice, keyboards, wall clocks and the like. That's all I need them for. These cells meet those requirements and that's all I care about. For high volume stuff I use NiMHs, but you just can't beat the price. I am finding that many of the Amazon basics products are a hit. I have bought several things and all have worked just as good or better than the higher priced competition. Good job Amazon."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Worth the money. Used these batteries while camping for two weeks and they are still working great. They will probably be used at home or used again next year during our camping adventure.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best deal I have found!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent batteries, I couldn't believe how inexpensive they were. I will continue to purchase Amazon batteries from now on. I use these in my video gaming controller daily and they last for a long time. Very happy that I purchased these and would recommend to anyone!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice and fresh, dated 10 years out! I use these in everything, should last a long time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent item! Works great and is exactly as pictured in the description
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've used these as a replacement for the nearly double in price of Duracell batteries. These last just as long as the Duracell batteries - a minute or two does not make a difference as my devices are on 24/7 - especially when these batteries are half the price! I have not had any leak, whether they were in their package or in any devices. The expiration dates on every shipment I've had so far have averaged 9 years with some 10 years from when I received them. This means they are fresh (recently made) and haven't been sitting around on a warehouse shelf for long. I like the green circular negative (-) indicator with the check mark (tick) on the side. Makes for quick installation in poor light. Excellent value and excellent performance!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent power and price. You can't beat this deal on high quality batteries. Even the club warehouse prices for their own store brands are more expensive than these.They provide more than adequate power for everything we've used them for.They work very good for small flashlights too.Seriously. You are not going to find a better deal for high quality, reliable alkaline batteries anywhere."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Like most people I use tons of batteries. The super high price and hassle of the marketing and nomenclature of buying them at the store is removed by buying these Amazon battery packs. More and more I am realizing that when possible it's a good idea to go with the 'Amazon Basics' products (especially for items like batteries). Certainly there are premium batteries that I have trusted for years and will continue to purchase. But I have found no difference between these Amazon batteries and my favorite other brands. So instead of buying 2 or 5 packs of batteries while waiting to check out in the store think about getting a realistic quantity of excellent batteries for half the price (maybe not half, but certainly less than name brands)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,WORK GREAT
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent price and they last for a long time. Have not had one leak either, like the other brand I use to use."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I haven't tested the duration of the power from the battery, but the price, quality of shipping, quality it of the batteries are Excellent."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have used inexpensive dollar store batteries in the past. I became curious about the actual performance data of cheap vs. name brand batteries, and discovered that essentially you pay approximately the same amount per unit of power, regardless of battery (with the exception of lithium ion which cost more per unit of power). Also, I noticed that the cheap batteries did not work as well as name brand with my automatic wine bottle opener. So, if I am going to pay the same amount of unit power per battery, why not get the ones I have to change the leastI was pleasantly surprised to find these amazon basics batteries at a cost per battery that is significantly lower than name brands, but with similar performance characteristics as the name brands. Assuming the marketing information is accurate, these batteries should last a long time, and not cost much. This is an ideal combination in my opinion."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent price, and they are long-lasting batteries. I have no interest in purchasing batteries from anywhere else from now on."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good price, good quality and shipping time much less expensive than at the local drugstore. will buy again.."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent batteries, work well, price is right. Cannot tell difference between these and the name brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,this is a Excellent Productis everything as expectedfits all the i need from a product like this one
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"My husband uses these batteries in his insulin pump. He was buying expensive brand name batteries because he thought they would last longer. I ordered these AmazonBasics for him and it is a great buy. As far as lasting, they last as long, if not longer, than the name brand batteries. I would say to anyone who is thinking of getting these batteries, you will not go wrong with them. Try them and see what you think. This is the battery we will be buying from now on."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fresh batteries with excellent shelf life and in use duration -- superb price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent product for the price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT,GREAT QUALITY AND VALUE"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent product!!! Last long, no problems."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent purchase, especially for the price. 2 toddlers in the house make batteries a commodity item. There are excellent reviews that compare AmazonBasics to the usual battery brands. I highly suggest you read them to see that there really isn't a difference and since the price is so much lower these are a no brainer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent quality
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Tested and performed as good or better than the leading brands. I have many Amazon Basic products from micro USB chargers to HDMI cables and all are excellent quality. You would be crazy not to buy these. Amazon for President
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've been using these batteries for awhile now, and I'm very happy with their performance. The quality and the price are top notch!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work just as well as the name brand batteries at the fraction of the cost. This battery pack bundle is reasonably priced and last very long. I purchased the triple AAA battery bundle as well because of how well these performed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is the 2nd time I've ordered these batteries. They work every bit as well as the big name brands, and for the price, you can't beat the value. I will continue to use AmazonBasics batteries in my house- I cannot recommend them enough!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work just as well as any other brand and here I am several months later with a nice stock of batteries. The price/value of this pack cannot be beat.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These really do last a long time. I have bought them more than once and will again. Definitely recommend.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These AmazonBasics AA batteries are a phenomenal value for the quality you get! The batteries last quite a long time and they're well worth the price you pay.We go through batteries at my house like they're going out of style, so finding a bulk amount for a reasonable price was a bit difficult. These batteries solved my problem with that. It was a great purchase, and I recommend them for you folks out there that go through batteries quickly. You'll find that to not be the case with these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I find these batteries are reliable and work consistently to satisfaction. I use them in remote controls, thermometers, alarms and wireless devices. I will continue to buy these batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"excellent value, seem to be excellent batteries and extra leak protection makes them even better, I will buy more"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work perfectly in every application I've needed them for. They have so far lasted just as long as the copper tops I usually buy at a significant price savings.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Why buy batteris at the drug or grocery store for relatively high prices when to can get large amounts more cheaply Thesed are nicely priced and as good as any national brand!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good batteries, i got a 20 pack of the AA batteries. Batteries indicate good through date of 2026!Good life, bright in flashlights also. I will purchase these again, i consider them an excellent value and a great buy!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value product!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"With some reservations these appear to be excellent batteries. I replaced some Duracell batteries in several LED flashlights with these and the light was much brighter with Amazon batteries (side by side testing, two identical flashlights). I am impressed. On the down side, the date (I supposed expiration date of shelf life) is almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. It is very readable on Duracell batteries. These were 2025 dated, so obviously they are 10 years out, and that's very good, will surely use them up long before then. The packaging is simple, but more or less necessitates a container to store them as they will just fall all over the drawer once opened. In hard to read print on the batteries it says made in Indonesia. Not Japan as some reviews had thought might be the country of origin. BTW -- the Duracells AAA's I removed from my flashlight leaked badly and ruined the (expensive) flashlight. Therefore I am sticking with Amazon batteries for now."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is a great deal and I will certainly order again!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price. Haven't thoroughly tested yet. I like the NO LEAK reviewd
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Good price but batteries don't last long compared to other brands
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I cannot believe what a great deal these are!!! These work just as well as any other name brand battery. I have a two-year-old and therefore we go through a LOT of batteries for his toys. I will never buy any other battery again!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,facemask
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These are fair batteries. They are fine for most toys, etc. but they don't seem to last as long as Duracell or Energizer batteries. And I've found some of the packs to be hit or miss. I've had a few packs with several of the batteries already nearly drained straight out of the package."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I was searching for rechargeable batteries and these came up. I did think it was a great price for rechargeable batteries so I bought two packs. Didn't realize they were regular batteries until they arrived. I was a little annoyed. I blame Amazon for showing me these when I was looking for something else.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kids can't play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fantastic batteries for a fantastic price! High quality. Shipping was super fast as I received them the next day after ordering. Happy customer
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Five stars.They all worked, there were lots of them, and they didn't cost a lot.I like that they are packaged four per set in the big box, so there weren't just batteries EVERYWHERE!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I didn't even know amazon made batteries until I worked at an event where there were remote control cars for kids to play with and these batteries lasted a long time. In a 5 hour period I think we only went through 2 sets of batteries per car.. and these things were running non stop! That sold me on their quality, so I bought a box for the house!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fantastic batteries. I used to buy all of ours from big box stores in bulk. These are a much better price and last just as long as the other brands. Now I buy them all from Amazon!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is a great buy! Shop compare. I will definitely reorder. I have already recommended to friends.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Really great product. Tons of batteries and for super cheap. I haven't had any of these die on me yet but even if they last only half of other brands it's still a really great buy. Super happy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It was so convenient to purchase the batteries along with the device I bought for Christmas that needed the battery. It shipped right along with the gift.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love stocking up on batteries at this price. Amazon, you've done a great job supplying the masses with inexpensive batteries"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was skeptical at first of these batteries because they were so much cheaper then most but we have been using them exclusively for several months and they last just as long as other name brands
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries have performed just as well as the expensive ones with the super fancy space age look to them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries rock, and they last a long time and are way cheaper than other batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These seem as good as top-tier brands and models.Using these on professional audio equipment... the equipment ran the same amount of time.I think the only difference, is they are vastly less expensive."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Am amazed at how well I'm loving your batteries, Amazom. I have been a loyal Duracell buyer, but find yours are not cost way less, but last longer. Would give them 10 stars if you allowed me."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fast delivery of product as advertised.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fast delivery. So far light up well. Hope that it will last long.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Started drinking the tea a week ago and already see results. Fast shipping and great quality, unlike the store bought teas. Loving it!!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"mu AA Amazon batteries made in Indonesia were without power after 12 months, bought in May 2016"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,One of my all-time favorite coffee flavors. Extremely smooth with no tangy aftertaste.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,After less than 6mos I started seeing a lot of leakage.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Finally decent batteries at an even more decent price. Will definitely be coming back when I run out. Only thing I'd change is the packaging, but I'd rather the price stay where it is as the packaging isn't that big of a deal"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works as expected from a battery. Would buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good product at a great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just as described.Fine product.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work great fast delivery good price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They are fine as far as I can tell. (These are probably a private label version of a major brand.) I am counting on the Amazon brand in assuming they are identical to batteries from other brands. Good price, of course. The 5 stars really reflect my trust of Amazon."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,ya....fine .....I mean its a battery .....How long they gonna last
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Had to wait for more than a month for delivery. First few uses of product has not been good. In a head set had to replace batteries (3) with very small usage, evenings only, had to already replace batteries. The AAA pro cells we normally order usually last a week or better with daily use. I am not pleased with this product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"First one out of the box I placed in a Swissphone Fire department pager. Battery indicator had 3 levels, and a new battery only shows 2 bars. That's rather disappointing, I should have stuck with Duracell, they show full charge."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I used it in a computer key board. First pair lasted only half of the time of other brand like DURACELL.I will see if the second pair does any better.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,First time purchase. I have just started using them. Seem to be a quality product. I will have to see how long they last.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"The price is very acceptable, however, feed backs on file indicate these may be a trade-off for shorter life usage. One review stated having experienced battery content leakage. In any event evaluations must be based on individual usage over a reasonable length of time, so I'll reserve my decision on re-orders after first order usage"

Can't beat the price for the amount you get, they work as expected, and long lasting. In my opinion the box they come in is extremely convenient compared to other battery packaging."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,yup...they are batteries and they work just fine
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are working great at the fraction of the cost of name brand batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,All of the AmazonBasic batteries are great. i am stockpiling all sizes because i can afford to at this price and having these at the ready is highly pleasing to me the neat freak. i also suspect these are fresher than ones you pick up at other stores that have perhaps been in their warehouses for a period of time. i got some from such a source and nothing powered up and then when replaced with AmazonBasic batteries my battery candles lit right up. Great Buy and in good quantity.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,batteries are fresh
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,At about a quarter apiece you can't beat these batteries. EXPIRATION DATE: I bought these in NOV of 2016 and they expire in 2026.AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack) - Packaging May Vary
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I've ever seen."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Never again will I purchase this. The outer cardboard box is frustration-free, but the batteries are tightly shrink-wrapped in groups of four. You need to cut into the wrap to begin to separate the batteries, pull them apart, then cut a little slice into the wrap around each battery. Then figure out how to pull each battery out of its little, plastic strait-jacket.Even if these batteries function well, the hassle of unwrapping them (12 shrink-wrapped sets of four batteries) isn't worth any cost savings."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are holding up well with my battery operated LED candles.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They are in my new motion sensing closet light, and they light up nicely."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great performance great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have several packs of Amazon basic batteries, and they do the job. They are not high end batteries, but they do exactly what they are advertised to do. All of the ones I've used or tested were fully charged and worked great."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Cheaper than batteries from the store, with basically no sacrifice to funcitonality."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Did not work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Shame on Amazon for putting their trusted name on this garbage! Nothing I put these batteries work properly whether AA, AAA, C or D, not the blood pressure cup won't fill with air before going into Error, motion lights that flicker when these are put in, remotes that work on and off - which all goes away with name brand batteries!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"When I purchased the Fire Stick, these batteries were included. In less than three weeks they were dead and had to be replaced. The batteries for the Fire Stick are used only in the remote, so it is not as though they got much use! I would never recommend such a garbage product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Feel like these loose their charge much faster than the brand I used to buy. Will not purchase in the future.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great buy
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great value..
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great. Batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works great. All I use now. Order a big pack of these
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are great batteries and they are real light on the pocket book compared to other National brands!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazing price, amazing quality"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are holding up great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I will never not buy batteries from Amazon in bulk again! Cheapest price for a ton of batteries! I feel like I'll never run out!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Don't last very long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries, great price. Gotta love Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Great price but not long lasting in comparison to higher priced competitors. I got about 1/5 of the life I would with Duracell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The amount you get is better paid for the quantity and quality you get from like target or another store.I personally love it and haven't really made a dent into it :)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They work well. They dont last as long as duracell or energizer, but do seem to work as well if not better than most store brand batteries. They are about the same price as the store brand batteries and shipped for free. Makes them a better value in my book."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for a great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Recommended by Gina.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,girlfriend is diabetic and this pack will charge her pump all year. life saving product and last longer than duracell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,they work
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was impressed how well these work and how poorly some of the brand names don't. Glad I got them!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Although I've not been able to compare the longevity of these batteries compared to the ones I used to get, I am impressed. I've had no leaks, the thin cardboard box is easy to remove and less wasteful, and I LOVE that I can store them in a drawer in the simple plastic shrink wrap of the inner packaging. It can make them a little harder to dig out of a busy drawer, but it means they take up far less room in the drawer. Very convenient."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"For the price,they are well worth it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Can not complain, they arrived on time, I'm not expecting them to last too long, but I needed batteries for some toys, so."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Always work great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Found no difference from brand name batteries. Lasts just as long, easier to manage packaging, and it's almost one third of the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,There batteries do not last as long as Sam's or Costco brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Bought a 20 pack to give them a try and found they dont hold up well in the tv remotes.... gone back to duracells
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Are as good as any on market and price is better.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"As cheap as the warehouse bulk store brands, seem to run at least as well. Output on several tested is right on at 1.5 volts, seem to work well for most applications. 24 cents each delivered is cheaper than I can find elsewhere."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Been using them for flameless candles Work well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Checking these out. Hope they work about as well as Duracell or Energizer. We'll see. Good price

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I like the amazon batteries and they have different sizes and quantities to order. I'm satisfied with the length of time they last and the price is OK also.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,8/25/16 Very neatly packaged in an especially excessively packaged cardboard box - The batteries arrived as shown in a very protective box. The batteries themselves fit slots designed for AAA batteries - Duh ! The price and Amazon convenience make a perfect deal.I'll report their durability in my temperature and humidity sensors in a few months.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seems like I have had several recent needs for AAA batteries. This should keep me in stock for awhile.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries at a good price very convenient to get.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good batteries, good price. No issues."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Can't beat the price. Alkaline is not the best tech - but it is a low cost battery. I'm NOT really okay that Amazon owns the marketplace and also competes against manufacturers like Duracell. They've got the upper hand. Something seems unfair about this situation. Amazon should not be competing with manufacturers - I won't buy these again. Right product wrong maker. Amazon will soon be making everything and shipping it directly in its own boats and aircraft from offshore. Is that good for me Yes, because it saves me money. Is it good for America Not really - it kills jobs. I'm going to pay a little bit more and buy my batteries elsewhere."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I received what was advertise, which is pretty good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I always need batteries and always find myself looking for them or going out to buy some. I use them, as I'm sure most people do, primarily for household items as clocks, remotes and fire alarms. I ordered an assortment of sizes and found they last as long as any other battery I use in these common items. Yes, even as long as Duracell and Energizer. I haven't tried them in items such as flashlights or RC devices as most of the ones I have are rechargeables anyway. They come packaged neatly so I can store them for easy access and I don't have torn to the store. I have found every Amazon Bascis purchases has been of Quite good quality."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Perform comparably to Duracell, Energizer. I only buy name brand, so it is significant that I'm happy with these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,GOOD BATTERIES... GOOD AS THE MAIN BRANDS AT 1/2 THE PRICE!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,nothing but good luck with the Amazon Basics Alkalines.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Always looking for AA batteries, controllers for Xbox seem to need a lot of batteries. Nice packaging, too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are batteries, so you really can't write much about them - looks just like the picture (LOL) they work... and really, the highlight about them is that it's from Amazon, so it's easy to return if you don't want them... but also, for this bulk quantity, it was also a very good bargain for how many pairs of batteries you're getting versus buying from a store in person."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries. Have not had any problems with them. They come very nicely packaged with Amazon's fustration free box.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Not bad... in testing these.... they didn't last quite as long as Duracell Copper top, but not bad. Great for regular products, flashlights, clocks, toys and what have you. If you have heavy drain, audio equipment I would still recommend a Duracell. Everything else.... these are fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Good price but I can't tell if these last as long as Duracell. AmazonBasics with Amazon Prime are a great deal though, and I'd probably buy them again. I haven't had any problems with corrosion or other concerns."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good batteries for a good price. I just got them before Christmas, and I used them in battery operated lights. They worked really well, lights were bright but they didn't last. I don't think it was the battery but the lights. I'll stick to a 5 start until i feel that they didn't work with anything else"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Pretty good batteries, they seem to last quite a while in kids toys, similar to Energizer or Duracell."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price and so far great quality! I haven't had them long enough to say if they last as long as other brands but so far so good!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I have many AA battery operated things in my house. I use flameless candles that come on every night and stay on for 6 hours.

They seem to be a high quality battery, unlike some others I have purchased only to have them last half as long. These are great!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I am impressed with the quality of these batteries. They last as long as expected in comparison to other brands. I am constantly needing good batteries for my childrens electronic toys and my husbands various gadgets, so it is great that these come in a pack of twenty. This is a thrifty way to get quality batteries, especially when I go through so many in just a short amount of time. They are packaged in a small, cardboard box, which can be opened and closed. This is great for storage and accessibility. I would recommend these batteries for sure. They are exactly what I was looking for. I will most likely be purchasing these again very soon."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Between video game controllers, camera's, mp3's, and kids toys we go through batteries pretty quickly. I decided to give these a shot based on the price. I honestly was expecting they would drain quickly and only be good for low drain items like remotes. I'm happy to say I was wrong. They seem to last us just as long as the name brand batteries at a fraction of the cost."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Don't seem to last as long as Ray-o-vac but the price is right. My impression is subjective, I haven't done any controlled tests."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These batteries work great but they don't last as long as name brand batteries but that's ok. We mostly bought them for my toddler's toys and they work well enough for that!-As a wife and as a mom of 3 kids, I spend a lot of time shopping for deals on the best products out there for my family. It's important to me that if we're spending our hard earned money that we get a top notch product in return. I often rely on the reviews and opinions of others when contemplating purchasing a new product that I haven't tried before myself. Because of that, any products that I buy (whether on Amazon or from a 3rd party) I always make sure to leave a detailed review of the product to help others when selecting items to purchase, as well. My family tests these products fully before forming a solid opinion and writing a review. When I write a review, I keep in mind that those reading are also looking for honesty about the product and want an unbiased opinion to go by. If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a Yes vote on my review. Thank you!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Batteries are good, duracell might last just a tad bit longer but the price difference is not worth the extra . Kind of hard to review a batteries, but the packaging was easy to open and the batteries were neatly packaged."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Batteries seem to work alright, and fairly good price.Have purchased them many times now. It's amazing how many batteries you go through with all of the kids toys.I don't think these have corroded like some of the other house brands that we have bought over the years."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Buying batteries is a bummer, Amazon makes it less painful. we like to keep a lot on hand as just about everything takes a aa battery. I haven't noticed any difference between these and the more expensive brand. money saved is a win!"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far I am very happy!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was expecting less performance giving that these are the cheapest batteries I can find but I'm pleasantly surprised with the life of these batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"When I ran out of AA batteries, I of course came to Amazon to purchase more. As I am on a tight budget, I decided to go with the AmazonBasics brand. When they arrived, I immediately replaced the batteries in my Xbox controller. I noticed that the batteries did not last as long as the more popular name brands. (i.e. Duracell, Energizer, etc.) This is the only reason I have rated the product with 4 stars instead of 5. Everything else about these batteries is great. I am getting low already and will probably order them again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Always need a battery for clocks, remote controls, shortwave radio, etc. These are inexpensive enough that I always have a replacement nearby when necessary.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I am pleasantly surprised with the Amazon Basics batteries. They seem to stack up with the name brand batteries just fine. Dollar for dollar, that makes Amazon Basics a winner! The best surprise of all is the absolute genius way of packaging the batteries. The box is perfect! I no longer need to dedicate a container because of the cardboard box that they are shipped in works great!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I'm a huge fan of AmazonBasics items and these AAA batteries are no exception. They seem to be of equal quality (as far as I can tell) to the big brands. They seem to be long lasting.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I have not had them long but they seem to be doing the job that is required. I will check back in later to discuss battery life if I remember. I will say, that I could have found batteries a bit cheaper around town and on the internet so I probably will not buy these again for this reason."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far so good. Batteries last. Only issue I have had is the wrap around the batteries are a hair thicker than normal which makes them a very tight fit compared to others. I had a few ripp bc they didn't fit

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are good cells. I haven't had time to run them down yet, sso no thoughts on life expectancy"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seems to be ok and lasting just as long as normall names..good dates which is so important
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"All I can say, for now, is they were delivered as promised, look good work well (so far). I think this is a good deal."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries work well. Seems like a shorter charge than a duracell or energizer but for the price its worth it. Batteries will be changed a little more often but it seems to end up cheaper in the long run. Either way I am happy
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,GOOD DEAL

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Who couldn't use a good supply of AA batteries. And, it makes a lot more sense than buying them 4 at a time at the convenience drug or grocery store. They are as good as any brand I have ever purchased in the past."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work great in my children's video game controllers last just as well as the name brand batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,work just as well as brand name for a better price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Worked as expected. Fast shipping.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,With children's toys were were burning through batteries quicker than I ever thought possible! So we needed a bulk supply. I didn't expect much from a generic brand. But these batteries are just as good as Duracell or energizer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries for my Christmas lights. I like the fact that I can recycle them after they run out.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Super deal, and work great."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Will update but no issues so far. Good deal on batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are a great deal - comparable to warehouse retailers' prices. While I did not do extensive capacity tests or anything like that, they have met my expectations and I will be purchasing AmazonBasics batteries again. As a member of the military and a college student, I need many different batteries for everything - calculators, flashlights, gadgets, etc. The convenience and price point makes these a deal I can't pass up."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good deal. 48 for the price of 6 in a big box store. They seem to be fresh and have a good charge. I'm not sure how long they will hold up, but for the price, it's all good. I'm going to order a few different sizes if these last in my mag lite. (It gets used a lot....that's my test.)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal on batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I go through a lot of batteries, so for this price, these are a good deal. They are lasting a good deal of time and I would buy them again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,One of the best deals out there for batteries! Comes in a nice box for organized storage and future use
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Such an amazing deal for the price. Shipping was fast. I went with these batteries because the price for the amount of batteries you get is just superb.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are great batteries at a phenomenal price and the way I go through batteries, a great help!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work well. Price was right.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries work well and are priced appropriately. I would buy them again and I do recommend them
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price . Working out well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice, well packaged."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good deal.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"OK, I bought them in February 2016, I put the box of batteries in the storage compartment of my truck. They have sat in high Heat, extreme Cold elements for over half a year. I finally ran out of my other pricey batteries and decided to try these. I did not expect great results from them sitting in bad conditions for so long but they have surprised me. These must be a relabeled high dollar battery because none are off voltage or failing to perform as new."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good batteries. They last just about as long as name brand and they're cheaper.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Inexpensive however I do feel that the power doesn't hold as much as other batteries that are around the same price like Best Buy's Dynex brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It serves its purpose.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are basic AA batteries that get the job done. They may be cheaper than Duracell or energizer but they do not last as long in my experience. So you must decide if you prefer quality over price... I would buy these again because they are good enough for me. Much like most of the amazon basics product line, these hold up and if there's an issue, amazon will let you return them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good enough for the price...I use these as mouse batteries for remote keyboard....I seem to go through a lot of them in a year...but still...no way to compare if Duracell or some other brand would be lasting longer....This is cheaper and so I keeping buying them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They could be a bit cheaper for their longevity but they are a good value overall.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"As a rule, it's hard to tell the difference between one alkaline battery and another. Pull the Duracells out, and put in Everyready Alkaline Energizer, and you won't notice any difference in performance. Fifty years ago, freshness was a big factor, but alkaline has a long shelf life. These alkaline AAs are indistinguishable from most brands.In a way, that's a shame. The copper-top Duracells make it easy to avoid putting in new batteries upside down.On the other hand, the packaging excels. Instead of a brick of loose batteries, sets of 4 batteries are shrunk together, making it easier to avoid loosing loose batteries, without consuming the space that the big cards with their bubbles consume. The 4-packs are in a corrugated cardboard box that looks llike it will last long enough for the purpose.These are enougfh batteries here to last me a long while. I'll be needing AAA batteries soon, though, so I'll order them in a month or two."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are good basic batteries. Probably not ideal for for things that need a high-performance battey, but for flashlights, remotes they are great and competitively priced."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These are good if you're broke and just need to get by. They work, but like other reviewers are saying, they don't last as long as other brands or rechargeable batteries. If you have the money, invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"basic battery. very basic, good for basic people."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Long lasting batteries for my deer cam, compare to name brand batteries for way less money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They don't last as long as name brands. You save money ...that's all.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Just regular AA batteries at a decent price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good bargain for batteries! They're great for remotes and toys.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price. I didn't notice any super long-lasting abilities. Just your typical battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Batteries for my MP3 player it takes one I sleep with it every night and the battery lasted me two nights around 16 hours in total time
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good deal that why I bought it, you should buy it too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"So far so good, they seem to last pretty long."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries work fine in things that don't use too much power like wall clocks and TV remotes. However,I bought them primarily for use in my xbox one remote and they do not seem to last nearly as long as brand name batteries. That said, these batteries are so cheap that it is probably still worth buying these over name brand even though you may have to replace them more often."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Good value for the money. I use them in kids toys and remote controls where they work fine. For heavy discharge items like flashlights and tools they will not last very long compared to other premium brands. I don't trust them in smoke detectors either.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Great prices. Don't last very long . Mostly used in my xbox one controller and am replacing them every other day
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love how cheap these are and how quickly they can be at my door. Ill never buy batteries at the store again. I haven't noticed that they run out faster than other brands. They have been pretty reliable. Great for everyday use around the house.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Not bad for the price only time will tell if good bye
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They last a while and are cheap. What more could you want
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Appear to last as long or longer than others.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Got these mainly for use in Xbox one controllers. They don't last quite as long as energizer lithium (I'd say maybe 75 as long) but for the quantity and price, its a good deal. Will continue to use."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice price and works well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Can always use these batteries. Great buy for so many.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"AAA batteries, for generic batteries these seem to last a long time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Lots of batteries for cheap. I'm not a battery aficionado but they seem to do the job. I would buy them again.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They last a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Ought these because of the price and quantity. So far we haven't had any duds and they are working great! None have corrosion either. We are storing them in the laundry room to ensure temperature control and so far feel that the quality is comparable to name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Bought these for little race cars for my grandson. He goes through those batteries like crazy! So I thought I'd try the Amazon basics ones. Why not Great price! I have not been disappointed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Honestly, I can't think of a time when I thought batteries of any brand were bad. I haven't run rigorous tests on these batteries but I put some in a remote and in some motion sensing lights and they're still going strong.I like the idea of Amazon branded products. It makes sense that you trust Amazon to sell good products from other sellers so why not get something straight from the source. It just seems natural that they would start putting the Amazon name on products.Overall this is a good amount of batteries for the price. I can't think of anything negatives, like I said, they're batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good long lasting batteries

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their 2A batteries. The 2A batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaked and were stuck together. Making it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They work as expected. Not as long of life as other batteries, but for the price they work well. I just use them for flashlights and remotes and bike lights."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good price and they work just as well as the major brands so far.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries to buy in bulk. We have security lights that eat batteries so it's nice to have a supply on hand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Seems to have a short life span, but overall good item"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Fully functional and seem to keep charge as well as one would hope batteries would. They came in a brown cardboard box which was actually really helpful for storing, and removing a couple without having batteries go everywhere."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Typical AA cell. Good per unit price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"decent battery for the price. Mostly I use rechargeable batteries. Until I found out my kids were throwing them away because rechargeable's look too similar to the alkaline cousins. So, for the everyday item that eat the better majority of a batteries life these do the job. For those items I change maybe once every 6 months, I use rechargeable,"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"what can you say, good price, good performance, smart packaging and quick delivery, a winner for me and with these multipacks there is always some batteries when you need them"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price. They work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Goof
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Great price. Too soon to tell if it is a great value.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Decent batteries. Seem like they do not last as long as Duracell or other brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Good Price but a short lifetime. If you use these batteries for any device on a regular basis, you cannot expect them to last very long."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I was excited to expand more into the AmazonBasics brand since all previous purchases have been very well received. However, these batteries were not optimal for devices that are constantly on. We used them in gaming controllers for XBox and each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gaming/TV usage.It's very possible we received a bad batch but due to going through the entire pack in just 2 weeks compared to other brands I will have to steer clear from these in the future."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are available at a good price and come in handy for rounding out orders to make free shipping minimums. So far they seem to last as long as the name brand products.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I purchased these AmazonBasics batteries because I used a lot of batteries around the house and I was looking for the best value. I would say the convenience factor is there: I can stock up on these and I don't have to run to the store to pick up batteries. Compared to the Rayovac brand, which I have been using exclusively before purchasing these, I would say the AmazonBasics batteries give you just a bit less life. They do store well and perform well in most electronics that I've tested thus far."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Good price. Have used in my TV remote and had to change batteries after2 months. Other brand of batteries have lasted longer. Get what you pay for.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Perfect, great price, love it!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"AAA alkaline Amazon batteries, they have a good price and seems to be working well, I will buy them again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Work as well as any name brand batteries I have used. They are not the cheapest batteries, but they actually work as well as name brand batteries which is something most discount batteries cannot do."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good price, work like any others."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Good price but quality is not really reliable.Some of them run out power real quick and others last super long.After 6 months storage, already have one pack of the batteries generates white powder type of corrosion (indoor, dry cool place, not used yet). Not sure it is quality control issue or stay in their shelf too long before shipping."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very good batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Work well, good price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Good price. When new, they tested on the low end of good with my voltmeter. I'll add to my post after I've had a chance to test battery life."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good price. convenient packaging. it fits nicely in my double secret emergeny backup supply kit for storms and zombie attacks.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price. Good product. Nothing to complain about this. Will probably continue buying these if the price remains the same or within a reasonable range.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price. Happy I purchased a bunch
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good price. Only used a few so far but what we used seems to last.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Trying these batteries for the first time and with all the good reviews I am sure they will be fine
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,good price on lots of batteries..
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice batteries that works as well as most others, even the expensive ones. We go through them in the remotes and game controllers. This is a great deal and worth the price.I recommend them and will buy them again."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They're batteries... What else can I say. They power anything that takes AA batteries and last just as long as the other Big brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Used for the led Amir motion detecting stick on lighting. Some battery batch didn't last long. The rest of the pack seems to be ok.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Good products. I like the Amazon batteries. The only reason they didn't get 4 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand. As the battery ages, it gets weaker. It lasts about as long as a normal Duracell or Energizer, but the output drops significantly as the product ages. They are great for remote controls, smoke detectors, etc. Not advisable for anything with moving parts or motors."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good product for the price paid! Thanks!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was tired of buying Duracell batteries only to have them start leaking and have to be thrown away even before I could use them at all. So far, these batteries have not leaked at all. I do believe that wrapping them as they are in just a few at a time has helped keep moisture from seeping into them. I have no complaints thus far with them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great product at great price. Last just as long as ones I buy from store. With having young kids these are well worth it
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Always great batteries. Good buy for the price but not the longest lasting.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Very good price for batteries, and they work flawlessly. Unfortunately, they don't come in their own Container to keep them together after opening. This means you need to have a small ziploc or something to store them in, or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Everything OK: Good product, received on time, delivered undamaged."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good product! I can't imagine that I can get some many batteries with such a low price! They are very long-lasting!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Haven't conducted any testing so I'm not absolutely sure about how these compare for performance to Duracell, Energizer or Ray-O-Vac. Gut feeling is that they are about the same as Energizer and Ray-O-Vac in performance and I can sometimes get Ray-O-Vacs on sale at Home Depot/Lowes for a competitive price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries. What else can i say
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They work pretty good.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries, last as long or longer than regular energizers and duracells"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I bought these to use in my Xbox one and 360 controllers. These batteries are great but then again 2 batteries might last 3 nights, the next set you put in might die in the same night or they might last for a entire week. These seem to be doing better than the rayovaks."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Lo cost for long lasting batteries.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are an amazing price and they seem to be just as good as brand name ones. I would rather purchase these than the ones at the store.

We have only had good experience with amazon basics batteries.I recommend them to anyone that needs some good lasting batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work just as good, if not better than any other battery."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good quality alkaline batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good batteries, last about the same as any other brand I have tried, but naturally these are more affordable. I mostly use them in my XBone Scuf controller. I play on average 3-5 hours a day and a pair lasts me a couple weeks or so."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"good quality and performance, great price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are a large package of AA batteries and even though they are not a name brand battery they do work just as well and last for a good amount of time.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice quality, lasted a while, and there were tons of them!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great value! They last just as long as any battery I could have gone and bought, but by planning ahead, I believe I ended up with a better value! Note...I bought these when Amazon had them on sale!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Battery life seems equivalent to other brands, and the price is excellent."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are good batteries at a reasonable price and have lasted far longer than the more expensive name-brand AAA batteries that I first installed in a set of motion-activated security and surveillance lights.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works exactly as expected.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good quality battery and the price is excellent.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries. We'll purchase again!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Normally I buy rechargeable batteries (AmazonBasics) because I find them more ecological and environmentally responsible. Also they avoid the frustrating performance of almost-exhausted batteries. However, I have a set of bathroom scales where the compartment for batteries is just too small for rechargeables. The difference is tiny but the rechargeables simply will not fit.So I had no alternative but to buy alkalines, and these were my first choice. I was not disappointed, they work well and should last a long time, given the minimal use they get. However, in this undemanding application, only time will tell. For the moment, they are fine and the price was very appealing."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I'm gonna buy some AAs on my next purchase.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Minimalist packaging, good quality, fast shipping. My new preferred method of stocking up on batteries."

Happy with these batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good quality!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Have been buying only Amazon batteries after I tested them. Hight quality, good durability and good price!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've seen these batteries on amazon, but was uncertain as to their quality. After using them for several months, they seem as good of quality (or better) then many of the fancy name brands. I haven't had any leaking batteries and they seem to have a long life."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These Amazon Branded batteries seem to be of good quality. I have not really had them in low drain devices long enough to make a 100 opinion but so far no problem.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good reliable batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Bought based on price. Now that we have had a few months, it would appear that these are as good or better than other name brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is an economical set of AA batteries. The batteries have been lasting quite a long time and I'm very happy with them!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love the price on this battery. I always bought Duracell or Duracell Pro and want to compare this type of battery to see how they hold. So far this battery is doing well compare to those more expensive battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Pretty good basic battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just as good as any store brand I've used a much better pice.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"they work well so far, cheaper than other batteries i have seen. hoping there wont be any leakage or anything."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Sometimes these outperform the bigger name brands. Mark the install date on them to prove it, a cheap way to find out yourself...js"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Generally I have good luck with Amazon Basic items. These held their charges about as long as expencted
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great price on good batteries that seem to be just as good as most alkaline batteries I've used

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"great value, hopefully these are decent power batteries. Says they are Alkaline so I'm hopeful. If these last well they will be my battery of choice from now on. Note they are available at great price as an add on to any 25 order."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Highly recommend as this is a nice quantity for the price. Thank you Amazon for making great values available for your customers.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I used to buy duracells from samsclub until recently I started to use Amazon Basics products. These batteries have good value. I use these in my remotes, in my car door projector lights (the ones which project a logo on the floor like a courtesy light). And so far I am really happy with the battery life. Yes there are really cheaper ones if I go up with the quantity but I don't like spent money to have too much batteries to sit in my shelf."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'm trusting that Amazon gets these manufactured at a premium manufacturer. Works fine but I'm not really putting it to the test. Good value compared to the major brands but slightly pricier than the off brands. I'll take it.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Long lasting batteries. Good value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Long lasting life
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They are batteries. They work. No problems.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is the 5th or 6th box I've ordered over the years. They work great, they don't leak as much as old Duracells do, at least for my use."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very good product. No issues. Great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We have young children, which means we go through a lot of batteries for toys, swings, bouncers, etc. I found it much cheaper to buy them on Amazon. They work fine and this brand seems to last for a while."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Work great for me. I have fairly small ankles so they may be too tight for someone with large legs but they should be fine for average. They DO keep my lower legs from swelling on long shifts and keep them from hurting which is great. And they feel good, nice and silky feel"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work well. Excellent value. Will see how long they last.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works as expected, and good value for money as batteries seem to be so expensive these days."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works as expected. Good value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Yay, a good value and now I have a big stock of batteries available when I need them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"So, I purchased a pack of these a month ago (11-Dec-2015) and was using them as expected, when I hit a snag. At LEAST 3 batteries from this pack were marginal/undervoltage (1.5V) out of the box. I found this out because I had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working. I thought maybe I had inserted them wrong, but no, the +/- marks matched the batteries. So I tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck. At one point, I had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back. But now my weather station would not power up either.That was the clue I needed. I got my trusty multimeter (with battery tester) and checked out all 5 of the Amazon Basics AA cells. Like all NEW 1.5V batteries, most of them showed 1.6V which is typical. Two of them were at 1.48V, which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage. No new AA battery should arrive with 1.5V. This is the first and only time I have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronics.I generally like all of the various Amazon Basics products (mice, HDMI cables, etc.), but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their AA batteries, but all of the house branded products. Buyer beware (Caveat Emptor) seems to be the bottom line."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good Value and Price. Good Charge life. I will be buying more soon.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good value and so far are working fine for me. I saw other reviews that mention a shorter battery life relative to other brands but I haven't encountered any problems yet.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good value for a quality product. Nothing special WRT performance, as far as I can tell."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Good Value for the amount of batteries you receive.Great for TV Controllers, basic items. Gaming Controllers eat through these rather quickly."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good batteries that work well
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Like to price and quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have had really good luck with buying AmazonBasics products, including these batteries.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"This is my review on AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack) from AmazonBasics. I love the value pack....Lots of batteries for a decent price.....I am always needing batteries for something so it's nice to have them on hand when you actually need them....These AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries don't last long. Yes, there are other brands that last longer but for the price it's a deal....."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price and they work
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good value here. They seem to last as long as the standard Duracell batteries that we used to buy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"For the price, one really cannot complain. It's a shame that batteries aren't this fairly priced everywhere. Amazon basics does it is again in my opinion. Good overall value."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I hate running out of batteries so I bought this giant pack. It's a good value and the batteries seem to have plenty of juice for normal, non-hardcore activities (TV remotes, flashlights, that kind of thing). I haven't tried them in any high-power devices like digital cameras or remote control cars not sure if they would be the best choice in that case.Edit: they do not last as long as Duracells or Energizers"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"batteries, good value, enough said."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"good product, works as expected"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"As far as value goes, I haven't seen any better for a pack of 100 batteries. We go through them in ridiculous amounts with the kids toys, like rc cars and other stuff. My son has magic tracks, and those little cars take 3 at a time and eat through batteries fast. I have noticed they don't hold a charge as long as my rayovac and duracell did, but you do get a ton for the price with these. I found them pretty comparable to the drug store off brand ones. I'll still be back for more of these when we run out, especially when Alexa has them as a deal."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"FIRST TIME I'VE TRIED AMAZON BATTERIES, SO FAR SO GOOD! I GUESS WE'LL SEE HOW LONG THEY WILL LAST"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works well, cost less."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I'm no master at battery tech, but I do know a good deal when I see one.I had to buy a ton of batteries for the Wii U remotes in our apartment. Given the fact that the Wii U, and thus the remotes that come with it, are basically being used 24/7, these batteries were a lifesaver for their price. We got a good month extra out of the remotes, and we only used 1/4 of the batteries in the process.The next time we run out, assuming this still has the best price per battery, we'll probably get this."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good, cheap batteries. They work well in my fire detector and in my remotes."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I searched online for inexpensive AA batteries, and Amazon was the cheapest I found. So far, they are performing well. I will buy these again!"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We'll see how long they last over time.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"No worries - grade A - works well, looks good -say no more -"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"For the price, you can't really go wrong. But they don'5 last long.The only problem is that the battery life is not long at all. If you are using these in a TV Remote (or similar remotes) they will last 3-4 months.If you use these in a flashlight or power toothbrush (or similar items), they only last about a month.It seems that these don't last long in items that you need to use daily for longer periods of time. But, if you are using these for a TV/STB Remote or a holiday decoration that plays music, they will last much longer (approx 3-4 months)."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're batteries. Plenty of 'em. The thing I like here is that Amazon is producing basic stuff like the Acme Company in the old Road Runner/Coyote cartoons, when the Coyote would order whatever he needed and it would be delivered (in the middle of the desert) in no time.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are great! They work just as long as the other brands. I really think they last longer but I have no proof! One thing I love is the price and how Amazon does not change the price all the time. They have sales sometimes but when I run out I can always come back and get the at least the same price if not lower and that means alot to me! I really do not like battery price shopping all the time and this makes it so easy! I hope that helps! ray333ray2001yahoo.com

So they're great to put into smaller electronics as the lifespan is not an issue."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works as expected, great batteries for the price. Ordered these for daily use, especially for my son's remote control car. Been using it in clock, flashlight, toy etc, and so far they have been running well. These batteries seem to last as long as the name brands you would purchase at the local shops, but much cheaper than the shops. It helps me save a lot of money and avoid the trouble of running to the shop every time I need batteries. What I liked most about is its packaged! It comes in a card box that can be open/closed and in it the batteries are packaged with a wrapper in a group of 4. That makes it easy to find a group of batteries in my drawer.

They proved me wrong and these are honestly the best batteries I have used. I've been using them for almost 8 months now and haven't had to replace any. Granted, I don't have them in anything that uses a ton of battery power, but for the price they're worth it even lasting this long.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I'm very impressed with these Amazon Basics AAA batteries.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Can't find a much better battery value on the market. I ordered a box of 48... enough to last me quite a while. Comes to about 25 cents a battery, for alkalines. About half the price of off-the-shelf batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Great battery value but they don't last as long. I will order them a couple of more times to see how they work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The arrived as described and all seem to work great! They were the best price of all the batteries, but are a quality battery."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I haven't noticed that these batteries go out any sooner than Duracell or Energizer (although they might). The price is right and I like how they come in a small amazon box for storage (as opposed to the plastic container). I purchased all the sizes!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was a little hesitant to buy these, but they've lasted longer than Duracell and Energizers in my electronic door lock. Great value as always with Amazon products!"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So Far So Good. I really like this brand and would recommend these to all
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"This is a great deal on bulk batteries, they seem to last a reasonable amount of time. They do not seem to last as long as the big name brands (this is based on how long between battery changes for my xbox one controller) .but for the savings it's well worth it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I am starting to think my teenage daughter eats AA batteries for extra energy. If you need bulk batteries, the Amazon batteries can not be beat."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We absolutely love this bulk pack of AA batteries by AmazonBasics! We find that they perform up to the quality of other well known battery makers (Energizer or Duracell) but at a much more economical price! It's also great to have this bulk product aroind the house when you have kids or a gadget crazy husband!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is a great purchase! I recommend it to anyone who isn't looking to spend the same amount for like 6 batteries. This is bundle is a great deal. The batteries last for a long time!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries on point. Top tier, seem to perform at the same level or better than Duracell's. 48-pack for this price is hard to beat! You won't regret it."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,these are great batteries and priced right...........so nice to have so many on hand!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries will give durecel and eneegizer a run for thier mobey any day of the week. Definetly a better alternative.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These seem to last well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is a great buy! I plan on purchasing amazon batteries from here out - fast, cheap, and they last as expected."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,its a great deal on batteries. hard to beat
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are batteries...no problem with them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries at a good price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great buy!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great buy! They last as long as name brand batteries, maybe even longer!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal. Awesome batteries that last just as long if not longer than other batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I go through a lot of batteries and this is a great buy!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are priced very well and also work great! I'm glad I bought them and I highly recommend them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They work great. I buy both these and the rechargeable ones. Couldn't pass up these with the great price. :)As I said on the rechargeable ones I bought, make sure they are room temperature before using. If they are too cold or hot from transport, they might melt or explode... But that goes for a lot of batteries. :)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Use these in the office for remotes and wireless keyboards and mouse sets. They seem to last as long as other more expensive batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries are a great buy, pretty much can't be beat for the price to quality ratio. I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"High quality, power and long lasting"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Much cheaper than the bunny brand or the copper top. Does just as good of job! Highly recommended!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE!! I HAVE USED several of these and they have exceeded my expectations.way cheaper then buying name brand at store. I will be buying these again in whatever sizes I need. Thanks amazon!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Packaged well, comparable to duracell or energizer...they work just as well for a fraction of the price so all and all a good buy and will be ordering more when needed......"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries work just as well as the name brand batteries and they last just as long at a much better price point. I purchased these for the company, but I was so impressed with them that I purchased these batteries in AAA, AA and D on my personal Amazon account for home use and paid the same for a bulk package of 48 as I would have for an 8 pack of name brand batteries. They come in a sturdy cardboard box that comes in handy for neatly storing them. Amazon also printed the size of the batteries on the side of the box, making it easy to just grab the ones you need. Never again will we be asking each other if we have any (insert size) batteries and if so, where are they...or even worse, having to borrow a battery from one device to work another!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am a Duracell fan. I am one of those types who uses a volt meter to test batteries prior to installation and often when I remove them I test them to see what is left at the end of its useful life. Duracell batteries are usually a good bit higher in their new state then any other battery I have used on average. They also seem to go for longer life cycles then any other battery and go lower as far as discharge voltage goes. These batteries are the first and only ones that seem to be close to Duracell. These are a better deal as far as price per unit goes. The difference in performance is not enough to pay more for Duracell batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheap and do the job! Like how they're packaged!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work as well as name brand. Much cheaper!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good deal and nicely packaged

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great Batteries

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I think this is a better deal than costco. They simply work
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I thought this was a great deal for batteries. I bought these for my computer wireless mouse at work and home. I always leave my mouse on and I know I shouldn't, I just forget!These are great and have lasted longer than I have thought. I've only used two out of my pack since buying this."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've been buying these batteries for a while now in every size.... They last just as long as the other ones, sometimes I think even longer and at a great price.... I'll never buy batteries anywhere else again!!!"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"they work great last long, maybe even better longer than big name brands"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This deal is beyond amazing. Come Christmas this box of batteries for the kids toys is going to be a great deal. I was able to fill everything that took batteries in the house and they last quite a while too
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We have a few devices that take a huge amount of batteries so I thought id try out these. They seem to be doing just as well as the top name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We have a lot of baby toys that are battery operated. Amazon to the rescue. Now, I can keep them all working"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"What a deal, nice, good life, way to go Amazon"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What a great deal. I just hope they will last as long as the big brands
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Yep, they are batteries. Dirt cheap. Why spend more"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal and a great value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Not much I can add to all the compliments already spoken about this deal....I have been ordering them for years and have never had a dud. They may not last as long as the very best that are out there. But that is what it takes to beat them. For the price they are a great deal and I highly recommend them...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'm o lynordering batteries from Amazon from here on out. Great deal and long lasting!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,My family eats batteries. These have lasted well - no noticeable increase in battery consumption - meaning good battery life compared to the Duracells we have bought in the past.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal buying Amazon branded batteries. These last as long as any others I have used. If they added a pre-paid mailer to recycle them it would be great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great Deal and so far I have not had any issues.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Like the new (to me) packaging for these batteries. I do not test as thoroughly as others but these batteries seem to work just as well as the more expensive name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal for decent batteries!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal for so many batteries. As far as I can tell the batteries last a long time. After putting them in a flashlight it stayed bright and didn't dim after heavy use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are seeming to last a good amount of time. I think this product is a GREAT value considering how many batteries you get for the price, they are reliable and durable as far as I have used them. Great bargain!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is such a great deal that I opted for the 100-battery package rather than spend the same amount on a pack of rechargeable AA's. At only 13 cents per AA cell, it is less than the cost of X minutes of my labor associated with charging multiple rounds of rechargeables (since I only have a 4-bay charger.) If you need a sizeable number of batteries at once, this deal is hard to beat.They're all meticulously packed in 4-cell wrappers, so you won't have 100 batteries rattling around and tipping over in a jumbled mess. The entire line of AmazonBasics products is impressive----these batteries are no exception. I will definitely repurchase these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal for a parent of 2 girls that have toys that all seem to require AA or AAA cells.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Great deal on batteries, however they tend to burn out pretty quick (compared to like a duracell). Price is still worth it!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal on batteries! We have used them in kids toys mainly and they seem to last about the same as any other brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great price, fast delivery...what else could you ask for"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Look its an established fact of life that if you are going to live life in the world of the living at some point you will need to buy batteries. You can purchase expensive ones that have slick tv ads or you can purchase dead duds at the .99 cent stores or you can achieve a happy medium and purchase them through Amazon. At this price point, this many batteries is a great deal."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I use these for my remote flash triggers and my intervalometers and they last a pretty long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We go thru a lot of batteries in this house so finding ones that work great and are inexpensive can be a challenge. These are both. These have worked with no problems. Would definitely purchase again. Thanks!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Double AA batteries for about for about a quarter apiece. Very solid deal. Five stars.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works as expected. Great deal on the item and have enjoyed using it.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Really a great deal for 20 AAA batteries. I'm positive they will work just as well as the higher priced batteries, lasting about as long as the other brands. Amazon Basics are good products... I'm using an Amazon Basics keyboard to type this review. From batteries to keyboards, don't be afraid to buy Amazon Basics products because they are just as good as higher priced products."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great deal- don't waste any more money buying batteries at the store! You can't beat the price and they work and lask as well as brand name batterys. It it amazing how much cheaper these are- and you get twice as many. I got these in AA, AAA, C and D. The main reason I even bought them was when I was looking for flashlight batteries- size D for my trusty maglight (yes they are heavy but I love them for it, they are perfect for a car and the weight keeps it steady if you have to put it down) and size C for a different flashlight. Of course I needed an odd number and couldn't believe how expensive they were in the store. I checked Amazon- had no clue amazon had their own batteries and noticed that in all of the sizes- the price was less then the smallest pack of that size in the store and had twice as many batteries. Did I need this many AAA batteries at the time- nope but let me tell you I'm so glad I got extra- less than a week after buying them I had already nearly used every one. I went around the house and replaced every remote and device I could find and they work great! With AA and AAA size I'd recommend buying a bigger pack- yes it does seem like a lot of batteries at first but trust me you'll be glad you got extra- it's one of those items every house needs and easily gets overlooked."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Buy these! Great deal, good performance. Repeat purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal! We've purchased our batteries from amazon the last several times that we've needed to restock.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very professional packaging. Packs of 4 are individually wrapped in plastic - very helpful in organizing (knowing which ones are new). They seem to be working very well in my electronics. Great deal!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice price, seem to work great! Will post again if they are no good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great deal, they are just as good as name brand batteries"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,An absolutely awesome deal! They seem to work really well. Will buy again!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Such a great deal for a LOT of batteries! It's always nice to have so many on hand. You never know when you're going to need them. Haven't noticed if the life is shorter than brand names. So far so good!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The ones that I have used appear to work well, and are still going strong. Great deal!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are a great deal for how many batteries you get. These are good quality batteries and last just as long as your typical name brand batteries.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work great. I'm impressed with the quality/quantity and price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work great and the price is fantastic. These are the only batteries we buy now. We stocked up on various sizes of the AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline Batteries so we always have some on hand. This is particularly handy with two little kids and countless toys in the house!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is a great deal.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is the best deal on batteries around! They work very well! I replaced the batteries in all my kids' toys.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work great. Good price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work just as long as the big name brands at a fraction of the cost

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Great deal!! So far so good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,this work great so far! Such a great prices I was waiting for them to fail but so far they are working like powerful batteries should!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great deal. While they may not have as much juice as Duracell or Energizer. They cast a lot less. They last close to as long as the big 2 also. These are also way better than the budget batteries out other, which tend to die out after a couple days. These are still going strong. So overall great deal, great product, and worth every penny."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great Deal.Arrived as described in standard, basic cardboard box--nothing fancy--and packaged safely.I'm using it strictly for wireless trackpad and wireless keyboard, and so far, it's out-performed Duracell and Energizer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Always quality, always on time. Love Amazon's batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are the best most economical batteries you can get for low volume consumption items (which is 90 of what we use these days). I've used dozens of these and never had an issue with corrosion are leaking. Used mostly in remotes, toys, flashlights and general household items. Excellent bargain. Now we need to get Amazon to provide recycling as well!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I found the electrons in this brand of battery to be more uppity than in other brands. They get jiggy wi' it.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great packaging and value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought 2. That is my review.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,i buy these all the time. get these and it wont bother you how many your kids go through.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Arrived on time. Great for baby toys
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These basics batteries rock. They are affordable, and they last plenty of time. Great for devices you cant use rechargeables in."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is the first time that I have bought Amazon batteries but the price was fantastic and we go through so many batteries with electronics,Grandchildren's toys,flashlights and numerous other items around the house.They last just as long as the best selling batteries do,nobody could tell a difference.Thank goodness I bought these before Hurricane Matthew because we lost power for days and these batteries held up very well and lasted a long time and you get so many to the box,48 total.We had mini flashlights,electric candles and large flashlights and I still have over a half of box left.I will be buying these batteries from now on and so will my daughter and sons.Very impressive!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work great for household items. I use them in my remote controllers and etc. These batteries are significantly cheaper than other brands and I highly recommend these for household items. That means items that require minimal power. Gaming controllers, flashlights, and toys are examples of non-household items."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Now that is A LOT of batteries. I did not take a meter to them, but they appear to last as long and work as reliably as any name brand battery. Great for keeping all those Christmas presents going."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We use these for our son's toys and they last a long time. No problems at all. Highly recommend these!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Not bad Amazon, not bad.The Good: Price, performance.The Bad: Longevity. If you're using these in anything that's going to see a bit of use, I'd just get the rechargeable which are great quality. For the price increase of some of the larger brands you will be able to replace the batteries several times before spending the same amount of money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I use these in my insulin pump. I have noticed that when I buy a larger quantity of batteries, I usually get a few duds. Not with these! Every single one has worked!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We purchased these batteries for remotes and any other small gadgets (non-demanding cameras, etc.) around the house that use AA. I will continue buying them as so far they have fit our needs perfectly."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I would recommend a more expensive battery for running electronics like cameras or Nintendo ds but they work great for remotes and other little things that rarely need to have batteries replaced
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works ok. Doesn't last too long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Great value for kid's toys, but they don't have the longevity of Duracells by any stretch. Definitely worth buying if you need a lot of batteries for cheap to top off all the noisemakers and remotes in your house, but I wouldn't throw them in flashlights or other higher-drain devices."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries and nice low price. Very comparable to name brand high priced ones. I will never buy another brand!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great buy, a lot of batteries for the price, no issues with dead or weak batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great for the price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Last a decently long time. Great for the price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice quality and good duration. And it's a great value. Plus it's a huge pack so hopefully I won't run out for a while.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Regular batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are a great deal for the price. It always comes in handy to have extra batteries around.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are great! They come in a frustration free box that is great for storing them. For the price, they work well for me. I use these for a LED motion sensor light that I use in my bathroom."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work fine at a great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work well
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries are a great value. I got the 48 pack and for the most part, the did not disappoint. However, there were a few that did not work. Then again, i've always been pleased with Amazon's products and will continue to use them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We go through a lot of batteries! I have a 7yr old believe me when this kid uses A LOT of batteries I mean it!! I was in the market for a quality inexpressive battery! Glad to say I found the perfect one! We are stocked for a while thank goodness. His controllers for his game systems require batteries and we go through many so far he has been using the same Amazon batteries for a week and the controller charger has not even gone down its still at full charge pretty impressive!! We notice the batteries we have been using get drained pretty quickly! Overall very happy with the purchase!! I think these will suit just fine for lots of toys!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We go through batteries in our household (3 boys) like there was no tomorrow. We have a few rechargeable stations BUT there is always a demand for batteries somewhere! After a bit of research here and other online locations, these batteries were less expensive and someone here did a great review and that is what lead me to buy these. We have NOT been disappointed at all and actually find them to last a bit longer than your name brands. Thank you Amazon and we highly recommend them! :-)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Plenty of power for your average household ham and egger.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They Work For Me, Don't See a Difference between the other brands. Its Cheap so I will buy it again when I run out."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Cheapest batteries around and seem to last just as long as duracell or energizer. Don't be fooled by expensive batteries unless you are using them in some high drain device that doesn't have a rechargeable, which don't even really exist anymore. Can't vouch for shelf life."

Yes, I know you aren't supposed to use a laser with dogs (I found that out 2 years too late). But that is the only way my dog can get enough exercise and not drive me crazy.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,A bunch of triple A batteries at a great price. I don't go to anyone anymore for batteries or chargers except amazon basics. There really is no need to pay more for batteries than the cheapest price. I would not be surprised if these are re branded batteries of some major manufacturer. Either way they perform up to par with other name brand batteries.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great for all of those Christmas toys. Great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great for toys as the last thing you'd want to do is run out of batteries during the holidays disappointing the kids. I've had no problems with quality and for the price I can't complain as it does the job. Thanks Amazon!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Great price! I finally put a big storage shelf in my garage so starting to stock up on things I use regularly. My only complaint is they are packaged in groups of four which is kind of a pain to unwrap each time you need them.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love the AmazonBasics Batteries. I only buy from Amazon Basics now, unless I need batteries right away or Amazon prices them higher than others, which has happened a few times when their stock is low it seems. The price is hard to beat for how many batteries you actually get and they seem to last just as long, if not longer than the more expensive brands. They definitely blow the cheap brands out of the water with their quality and life as well."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have a lot of electronics that require AAA batteries (baby toys mostly and of course tv remotes) , so decided to save some money and went with this.It's been a few weeks and the batteries are still going, just imagine two 12 month babies playing with toys that make sounds and lights on and batteries are still holding the charge.Even if the batteries didn't last that long, there's plenty of them to swap them for the price you pay."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Not much to say. They are batteries and they work. Great price and they last just as long as any others.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great deal on batteries!! These lasted the Christmas season for us (from early December to mid January) with no problems.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love this battery and the price is really reasonable
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are very nice and very high quality batteries. Batteries are not the most exciting thing in the world - until they die and you don't have any more! I would also like to mention (off topic, sorry) that I had a shipment of these go missing and Amazon was wonderful about replacing them.I will definitely get these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Exactly what it says basic haha, great product not the best, but definitely worth the price."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have a panasonic portable oral water jet irrigator which eats batteries every few days. The amazon batteries were the perfect solution,praiseworthy, work the same or better than the major brands, and come in a large enough package that I never seem to run out. They are alsoconveniently shrink wrapped in packages of four, so when traveling, it is not necessary to carry a bunch of loose batteries. Great product, great price,"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Fast shipping, great product!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love AmazonBasics items. For anything they offer, that's what I check for first before looking at any other brands. This is our second order of these batteries and we have them in a couple other sizes as well. They perform as well as the more expensive brands and last just as long. I will definitely be buying them again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are amazing! They are reasonably priced and come packaged in groups of four. My husband has to use batteries out in the field (Military) and he says as long as Amazon sells these and keeps the packaging the same, we will always purchase from them. They last just as long as Duracell and Energizer with the equipment that he uses and since they are packaged in groups of four, it is easier to store them in his pack and not worry about the batteries bursting and leaking into the pack."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I've used these in an ultrasonic bark control device and they're still going strong. Purchased different sizes of Amazon Basic batteries in bulk and they've all worked well and have been reliable over the past few months. And Amazon has their batteries packaged differently than you find at the store. They come wrapped in plastic in a cardboard box with a lid. It makes them easy to store in the regular box. These were made in Indonesia. Would recommend!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Does what batteries should and battery life is good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries held up just as well if not better than the name brands. For the price you can't beat it!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As expected.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"As described, great service."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We purchased some name brand batteries from Amazon. They turned out to be duds - began corroding very quickly and lost power quickly. They probably were fakes. The pic on Amazon showed manufacturer packaging but we received all of the batteries in a clear plastic carton.These batteries are not name brand but work very well. Devices that did not perform using the name brand batteries began working perfectly once these batteries were installed.If these batteries continue to perform well and have normal lives we will switch all of our battery purchases from name brand batteries to this brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Used them to refill window candles and they are great! Packaged well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great that I can order in a large qty. I have 5 kids, 2 leap frogs, 6 battery operated trucks, 5 remote controls and the list goes on and on. So we go thru the batteries like crazy. love the price for the bulk size."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheaper than my local box store. No complaints. Great value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fantastic value. This beats going to the store and getting the batteries there. Especially worth it with Prime shipping.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Feel like I found a great deal and love having back up batteries for my home as well as friends and family. So far I've used about 12 of these in different products - so far so good and honestly, great price/value and if/when I need batteries again, i'll be after these babies"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries. Work well, last long and are a great bargain."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great quality , best value ! Never going back to brand name"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great Value. This is a lot of battery here but if you have toddlers and they have toys, you will blow through this in a heartbeat. They work and have a good amount of juice. They haven't leaked yet."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value. We did a battery test with a flashlight. Worked as well as name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Have ordered these several times and get good use with them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am all about trying to find the best value for my money and these batteries are it. One of my friends was using some amazin batteries in some of her baby toys so I asked about them and she was saying that they hold up just as wel as the Duracell and more expensive mane brand batteries do. I'm hooked! Love these Amazon basic batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I find this to be the best battery value around. They work as well as the well-known expensive brand, but with the convenience of them being delivered to my house with no shipping cost with Amazon prime."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I hope they last as long as regular batteries. So far they are just as powerful.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love Amazon Basics batteries! They cost less than even the cheapest batteries from the dollar store, but they work just as well as the name brands. Best of all, I don't even have to get in my car to purchase them. I always keep plenty of these in my house since my kids' toys just eat up batteries!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I purchased these to replace the batteries in my LED motion lights that are used in my basement closet. For the amount of batteries I received compared to the cost, I doubt I'll ever buy the big brands again. I have no complaints."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It's great to have a ready supply of batteries which is one of the reasons I buy these in bulk. They last as long as higher priced batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love these batteries. They are an amazing price and work wonderfully.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,My first order of these. Tested as fully charged. Will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Nice and cheap last just as long as the expensive ones that claim they last twice as long than the others. Had a few duds from the others and these so no big complaints.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice value for these batteries... they all work well and last and the price is perfect! We always have to stock up on batteries for Xmas gifts so this was a great way to do that.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,One of the best deals on batteries Ive ever gotten. I feel like they are just about as good as Duracell or Energizer but for this price you cant deny the value. Ill be buying Amazon batteries in bulk like this from now on. It's close enough to the major brands for me to switch and enjoy the value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect amount for the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Pretty good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Rated by Consumer Reports as recommended, this is a good battery at a great price. True, it does not match the latest Energizer Ultimate Lithium, but that battery is far more expensive. These batteries come packed in a plain brown box, and sealed in clear plastic by twos."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Really good value for the money. There could definitely be less packaging material
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far they seem to last as long as the top brands for a lot less money! I will definitely continue to order these batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far very satisfied. Only used a couple up to this point.

As a mom with two young children, we have lots of things that require batteries. I've been converted from the big name batteries to amazon's little gem."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries last as long as the name brand ones and are a great value. Absolutely a must have around Christmas time, I plan to also purchase the AA pack next time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They are cheap and work well, no issues at all. Very pleased with my purchase."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Well packaged and long lasting.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What a great value. Lasts as long as any other brand name maybe even longer! I will buy again

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great value - awesome product.they seem to be holding up as good as any namebrand batteries at a fraction of the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries , great price , can't go wrong !"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Second time ordering these and it probably wont be the last. Very impressed with the run time and the price is right (especially if you are a Prime member.) It's been proven to me over many years both by my own research and feedback from customers that when it comes to branded alkaline batteries the differences between Energerzier, Duracell, Radio Shack, Panasonic Ray-O-Vac and Amazon are so negligible as to make price the real deciding factor"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are a great value for the price. They work just as well as the known brands like the bunny version. I like that I can get them from Amazon and don't have to remember when I am in the store. This comes in real handy around Christmas time when I am ordering gifts and always seem to need batteries. Thanks Amazon for helping out with my budget.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Bought these for various electronics and so far so good. I use to buy Procells but they seem to not last as long and I wanted to try something different. Amazon seems to make good generic products and I'm happy with these batteries so far.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are just as good as more expensive brands and are a great deal! I love the Amazon Basics batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Exactly as described. Packed neatly, arrived on time. It will take a long time to use all of these batteries! I haven't had any issues with the battery life. Work fine!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value for all those batteries! I have been using them with no problems for a couple weeks now. I guess we will see how long they last.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Can't beat the value here.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent value for money for non-rechargable AA batteries.Cheaper than brand name, but long lasting."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value for my business needs!! We go through many batteries at work the price point on these batteries are better than the one's I normally purchase from Staples. The box makes it easier to access and fits in our supply drawer more easily.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I thought that I would give them a try, and I am surprised that these batteries seem to hold up as well as the 'ole copper tops--a great value. I have now bought my second package of these batteries, because I still like them better than anything else that I have tried. Price, value, and quality considered."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value and quality batteries. I have 4 kids and typically go through batteries pretty regularly from all the video game controllers. I found these ones to last just as well as the other name brands for a lot less money. Highly Recommend.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The second batch of these batteries I've purchased. They are every bit as good as the name brands at a MUCH better price point.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Boxed nicely and great value for the money!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value for the money. Batteries seem to work well and don't appear to be of any lesser quality or power than the traditional alkaline I purchase at the grocery store or drugstore. Highly recommend.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great value for the price. these work basically the same as the Duracell I used to use, but they are so much cheaper!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So glad I tried these batteries. They work great and are much less expensive than what I can find in my local stores.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Used some tonight. great value for the price and did as well as other batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What can I say These batteries have a great price point and arrive when they say they will. They also hold charge and last longer than most batteries in this price range. I've ordered AA and AAA and am not disappointed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are a real steal when compared to store bought. Much more value when compared to free shipping from Amazon. Would order them again in a heart beat.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great for childrens' toys! Long lasting and well priced.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Great price on a value pack. Battery life is OK. Use for Wii remotes. Lasts long enough for your moneys worth.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Can't go wrong with a good value on high quality batteries. I love AmazonBasics for helping me save money. Batteries are great quality and price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"great price comes in neat four batteries per package, I recommend this product"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I purchased these a little while back. We go through batteries pretty fast in my house and I think that these are just as good as most batteries that I am willing to pay for. The price was right and that is the biggest factor for me when it comes to choosing batteries.I would recommend these to others, but at the same time.. if you are used to duracell batteries or another popular brand, these may not be right for you. You may consider buying them and comparing them directly to duracell and determining if the cost effectiveness is better with these or the duracell.Hopefully this helps you to make an informed decision. I will continue to buy these batteries myself.I would give it a 5 star review if the batteries lasted a bit longer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've been purchasing various sizes of these AmazonBasics batteries for a while now, they're a great value in comparison to other brands. We are often using these in fairly mundane ways---remote controls, small flashlights, toys---but have also had success with them in game controllers that commonly drain batteries really quickly.One bonus with these AAs: they are shrink-wrapped 4 to a pack within the larger box. This makes it really convenient to toss a 4-pack in a purse, backpack, or glove compartment: no loose batteries rolling all around, and you know all 4 are the same age when you pop open the plastic wrap."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries last as long as the more expensive ones, such as Duracell or Energizer. I will definitely buy again!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are really high quality batteries. I am very happy with my purchase!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I see no difference in performance than Duracell. We loaded two of these in one xBox controller at the same time as we loaded the last of our Duracells in a different xBox controller. My sons always play Minecraft together on split screen. The Amazon batteries have outlasted the Duracells for over a week now with similar usage patterns.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Bought these for an APRS unit mounted on my motorcycle. Eight batteries worked flawlessly for almost 6 hours of constant tracking, and still have plenty of charge to go on."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work just as well as the Duracell and Energizer, and last just as long, but at a fraction of the price. They arrived in a small cardboard box, and were shrink wrapped in groups of four, so they're easy to open, and easy to throw into camera bags, backpacks, gloveboxes, etc without dealing with bags or rubberbands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries are a great quality and superior value. The batteries last as long as other name brand batteries, but at a much more cost-effective value. I have used other off-brand batteries and have been disappointed in their battery life, but these batteries don't disappoint. Great if you have kids with toys that take batteries and need to have a lot on hand!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Can't review life expectancy yet, haven't had them long enough, but I tested every one and they were all fresh/full power."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fantastic value for the money and work great. I don't see any difference in performance vs. Duracell or other brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries for cheap! Much better than any off brands for a similar price. Last about as long as the name brands, and the bulk amount is nice as well."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries for the price! I mostly use batteries for simple things like my wireless mouse and keyboard. However, they seem to have pretty decent battery life in toys too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries! I would definitely recommend!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Great price and with a name like Amazon I feel these are going to be good. I bought for my daughter because I gave her something that she needed 27 (yes!) batteries for. Great value and plan on getting again if they work like I think they will. Only a 4 star rating because I don't know how long they'll last. So far so good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price! They work fine!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great value, great battery life!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great value...and so far, quality holds up."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I hate going to the store to buy batteries feeling like I might have to mortgage the house for a 4 pack. Ok, so maybe that's an exaggeration, but you get my point.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Is it just me, or is it a huge challenge keeping enough batteries on hand.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value. Performs as expected.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value. We go through a lot of batteries and these were a great price and held up to the competition.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,shipped quickly and arrived spot on time with the gift that required batteries that were not included......Such a life saver when shipping a gift that needs batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I was a little surprised how large a portion of these batteries measured as dead or low out of the box. I did not notice at first but a few batteries in some would last all of a day on low power items. I am currently sitting on 25 dead or extremely low.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"What can I say Great price for double A's which I always need around! Not sure what the life is, but I was buying batteries at IKEA and I can't imagine these would be much different and the price was great. I'm a big fan of Amazon Basics!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I seriously don't think I will buy these from the store ever again. These are half the price, and work well in all of my electronics."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Very good batteries that seem to last a lot longer than standard AAA batteries, I would assume this is due to the Japanese technology used to enable better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures. Would highly recommend at this price!"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I use these for remotes, and Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers, even after I get a low battery warning they still work a VERY long time and I can not tell any difference between these and more expensive brands. I will be buying more of these and possibly moving over to the rechargeable ones."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Inexpensive, reliable, and long lasting. These are pretty much the only batteries I'll buy anymore."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just as good as the name brand batteries for a better price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Long lasting great product
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love Amazon brand anything - had no idea they did batteries too! What can I say they're batteries! They seem to last a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love these compared to the big brands. I have these on hand at all times. They seem to last just as long as the more expensive options. Buying in bulk just pays for itself in convenience IMO.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far no issues. They're great batteries. They're such a good deal that after I got these I replaced the batteries in every device I own that uses batteries (to avoid old batteries corroding and destroying anything). So far dozens of devices (from flashlights to remotes) have been working perfectly. Very happy!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are great! work just as good as the expensive name brand
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Unbeatable price for this battery quality. Easily last as long as the Duracell and such and is much cheaper. Won't buy batteries anywhere else anymore
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Will purchase again!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,work great!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work great. Seems like the life is similar to Duracell. Love the packaging. I'll be ordering more of all the other sizes to stock up.One suggestion for Amazon: print or stamp in big letters all over the little box the batteries come in what size they are.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"You can't go wrong with Amazon Basics, in my experience."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You get the bang for your buck!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Has been lasting for a long time. Never bought batteries in bulk like this before but I'm glad I did. Packaged well and is sealed in 3s in a box. I plan on purchasing more in the near future. I recommend it.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They work great used all of them in 2 min on all my Kids GEOtrax trains.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"While these batteries usually meet my expectations, I had a dud that drove a clock for only 1 week, which is about 51 weeks less than I expected. I will still buy again as the price is right."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I was very surprised as the batteries I got were in date but didn't work very long compared to a generic AA drug store variety. Probably just got a bad batch but I ended up replacing them very quickly in remotes especially.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,By far the worst batteries I have ever bought I regret my purchase of 2 packs! Half of each box came without power and the ones that did were half life! If u found this helpful please rate helpful thanks!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,some are not functioning
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I got these batteries on Amazon Prime Day and I thought I got a good deal but half of them don't work!!! Very disappointed.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best bang for the buck on lot of batteries! Check out the Youtube review on my Jay Rule channel: AmazonBasics AAA Alkaline Batteries (36 Pack)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value. Love having on hand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Worked very well but I did not compare power density to other alkaline bateries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Seems to work well I haven't been using them long, but have not had any problems"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work and the price was right. Well done Amazon

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Overall, happy with the product. They work well."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice battery. Seems to work and last as long as the major name brands. Good deal.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Long lasting batteries and great price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They are packaged by 4s and the plastic is really hard to get off.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Nice!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Have only installed a couple at this time. I have had other batteries brands that would last, but has acid leaks that sometimes damaged items."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I have to change my mouse batteries and keyboard batteries like every two weeks with these..... before it was every few months.... horror story... constantly get ... mouse not connected , keyboard not connected ......sometimes starts within a few days....... going to pay more for the name brands"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,have you ever needed some double A batteries well look no further!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Don't know if it's my camera or the batteries but they seem to run down pretty quickly
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These seem to work well. Haven't used them for too long but they were a good price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Thanks.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are batteries. They work. Price is good. Haha not much else to say!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Having children that love electronics we always seems to be going through batteries. We have these on subscribe and save and it has worked out great. The batteries are comparable to any of the major brands in quality and performance. Great product overall.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Yea. Batteries. What can ya say. Ya can't miss with AmazonBasics.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Another way Amazon makes my life easier!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,An outstanding deal - just as good as an Energizer in terms of performance for a fraction of the cost.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"AmazonBasics delivers as it always does, high quality AA batteries at a much lower cost than competitors. Thank you AmazonBasics 3"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Whenever I need a product that I can be confident in without doing tons of research, I look for Amazon basics. These batteries rival Duracell 'professional' and Energizer 'Industrial' alkaline batteries in quality and endurance. I use them in my photography business and they never fail."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,High quality batteries at an excellent price. Will buy again when needed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These last the longest
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I get as good or better performance with these batteries as I do with any name brand batteries, but these are far less expensive, even compared to bulk packages in stores. I use a lot of batteries, so these were a great find! I love that the batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of four, thus making it easy to carry back-up batteries on-the-go. I have purchased these multiple times and will purchase again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,High quality batteries at a great price. They are comparable to duracell and come in a box with packs of four.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have bought several products from the Amazon basics line of products and continue to be impressed with everything they have made. The batteries are as you would expect AA size batteries to be. They have a good weight to the batteries, not like cheap dollar store batteries.They seem to power all my devices, including high current devices well. So far they have not leaked or cause any problems. I feel for the price you cannot beat the quality of these batteries.I would recommend the purchase of these batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The battery is great, and the price is reasonable too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries here! These last just as long as Duracell or Energizer, but you get way more for your money! I mostly use these for video game controllers and remote controls. They last as long as I expect and I have never had a bad (dead) one. I don't understand why anyone would pay more for the expensive brands. These are NOT dollar store batteries. High quality and durability with a price that lets me always have spares ready to go! Since I found these I have been ordering them over and over in multiple sizes."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just as good as Duracell. Would highly recommend for anyone living on a budget.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are high quality and inexpensive. I bought this pack to primarily use in toys like nerf guns. I was slightly concerned about buying a brand that I had never used before especially for a birthday party (even if it has Amazon's name on it).When I opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised. They have a decent weight to them. This is generally how you can tell the difference between cheap batteries and high-quality batteries. The heavier they are the liner they will last.After using these batteries for a Nerf battle birthday party to power large Nerf guns and throughout Christmas, I'm hooked. I have enrolled in a Subscribe and Save plan on Amazon which allows for an additional discount to have them delivered periodically.I would definitely recommend these batteries to anyone for whatever battery needs they may have. They are high- quality, inexpensive, Amazon.com backed batteries. There really isn't much of a risk."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Fortunately, very satisfied with the quality, despite the low price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, every Amazon basic product that I have used has been comparable to any other brand name (at a much better price)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I don't think I could run out of batteries now. Why buy name brand when these batteries have relatively the same life span and can save your wallet a ton. Highly recommend stocking up here as opposed to blowing through your cash at a convenience store spending twice the money for a pack of 6.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,FAST DELIVERY ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND !
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"It's a bargain! Works just as well as regular, higher priced batteries for a fraction of a cost. Highly recommend!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value. Great price. Long lasting.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Item as described, very fast shipper, highly recommend."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries at a great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Can't beat the price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for the price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Awesome product and quality!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked polarity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) So it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon AA with no problems."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Unfortunately, some of the batteries seem to be duds. I have replaced dead batteries with these, only to still have a dead remote. Great price, but I now know why..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I'm not sure if these are the same Amazon Basics batteries I purchased last time, the label is different. More importantly these seem to discharge faster or hold less power. I buy the 48 count box usually and its obvious to me already this box will last maybe half the time the last box did."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the AA and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price and can't tell a difference between these and more expensive brands. I buy again and again in every size :)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They powered my stuff. Amazing!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries. They last a good while.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Honestly, I don't think I'll buy batteries anywhere else. If Amazon keeps making these batteries same quality, and same price, I'll just keep reordering them here. No brainer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are batteries, what can you say about batteries. I mean they power stuff and were packaged like batteries are. I am impressed that Amazon has their own battery product. No complaints. Because they are batteries. Uhhhhh.........yeah."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Would buy again in a heart beat. These seem to be lasting as long as our name brand batteries in our under cabinet lights but 1/3 the cost.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These are batteries what else can one say did anyone get silver batteries instead of white Hopefully they will be better than the previous version.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What a deal! And finally I will not run out of batteries! What a great idea... a 100 of them!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Got these for the price point - rechargeables don't hold up as well or long as I'd like - really hate disposables but until the make a Nuclear AA battery that runs for 25 years or longer and costs under 5 these will have to do. Yet to see if they last as long as the higher price Bunnies.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Very unhappy with these batteries. Used them for my flame-less candles, 3 batteries in each. I use a remote to turn the candles on, so they were only on a few hours at a time AND only a few nights a week. Died in less than 3 WEEKS!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I suppose the most honest thing about them is in their name...BASIC!! I use them in my blood pressure monitor. I take my BP twice a day and it only takes about 10 seconds. The batteries only last about 6 weeks. I've also used them in my air conditioner remote which I might use once or twice a day, just to turn it on or off. Again, after about 5 - 6 weeks, they stop working. They are also used in my Alexa/Echo remote which is used more often, yet, they last about 3 months in it. This is the first Amazon labeled/made product that I have bought that was not rated a 5. Don't buy these if you are looking for a long lasting battery."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Horrible, do not buy.I bought these in AA and AAA and they all lasted just a few days. My battery tester shows them on the lower side of good when unused but doesn't take long before they stop working."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Horrible! Did not last 1 hour, in my devices. DO NOT BUY!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Batteries were horrible. As soon as I would put a pair in my Amazon Fire stick remote, I'd get a message that batteries were low. After a day or 2 I couldn't even wake the Fire stick up because the batteries were dead. Went through the hole pack in 2 weeks."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Went on sale 4 days later for 14.40 for 100 batteries. I paid 12.49 for 48 batteries. Hosed again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I absolutely love Amazon Spring end I never have any complaints they always stand behind their products although it's never needed because their products are normally made very well with quality materials I only buy my batteries off Amazon no I will not pay the price in the store as I find Amazon's batteries last approximately the same as like Energizer or Duracell and thieves Amazon basic brand batteries are probably half that price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I actually like them I see some people saying they don't like them but they actually work really good for me. I use them for my xbox one controller I play a lot. the first ones I used lasted pretty long I can't tell you how long exactly but it had to be around 6 or 7 days playing for about 3 sometimes 4 hours a day so I'd say that's pretty good. Im using my second ones now still pretty good so 5 stars all the way for me
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I always put new batteries in my three thermostats at the beginning of the heating season in late Sept to make sure they work through the winter. Never had a problem with Energizer or Duracell going the whole year. These batteries from Amazon all had to be replaced in February, won't be using them again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I always stock up on disposable batteries and I like trying new brands every now and then. This is my first purchase of Amazonbasics and so far I have no complaints to give. I like the simple package it came in. The battery seems to hold it's own in comparison to other brands. Is it the best well I'm no battery expert but I will say for the pricing it does an excellent job. Great value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am a professional photographer and have these as backup for flash. kids steal them for their gaming.. they work and last the same as every name brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Have installed some of the batteries in two devices and are working well I am completely satisfied with their performance.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I am disappointed with the quality of these batteries. I used them to light some low voltage decoration lights on the ceiling of my bus. They only lasted 1 day. Replaced with Energizer batteries and I am in my 2 week and they are still going strong.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I posted an entire review about the C batteries but I will reiterate here. I was once scared of the generic battery. I was scared that if I did not use the name brand, super expensive battery that I would be doing a disservice to whatever toy or electronic I was putting them in. This is not the case with these batteries. I know that there are batteries out there that are generic and have not worked as well but I am here to vouche for these batteries. I have been using them in everything and bought all the different kinds because of how well they worked and the value. The value for this amount of batteries and the quality of these batteries cannot be beat anywhere else. They have outlasted the expensive kinds in my daughters toys and in the things that I have placed them in around the house. I have not been disappointed and I was floored by the price. I do not mean to prattle on but I cannot say enough about these toys. As it gets closer to Christmas, parents all around are stocking up on batteries, I know I am. I have bought a pack of AAA, AA, and C just for Christmas. I could not believe the savings and you will not be disappointed with the quality. I am now an advocate for Amazon batteries. They do not disappoint!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries have kept things going at our house. I am pleased with them and order them regularly.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am satisfied the batteries I recieved are just as good as any other name brand batteries that you could buy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon Basics. I am so glad these are part of the basics. I love these batteries. I get equal or better performance as you might expect from Duracel or Energizer. The benefit is that I pay less. Every single time I walk past batteries in a store I think, Amazon Basics and then like Vector from Despicable Me, I can hear, Oh YEAH!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We use many batteries. I am so happy to be able to replace them without driving to the store
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I am very disappointed in these batteries. They do not work, or if they do work it is only for a few minutes. They are a waste of money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I needed batteries and after having read and seen so many positive reviews I bought my first batch of Amazon Basics batteries. I was an Energizer girl and was very skeptical of trying another brand as other attempts proved unworthy. I am very pleased by the quality endurance of these batteries! I started with AAA and they worked so well that I bought AA when I needed more. The price can't be beat either! These batteries serve their purpose well and last a long time - the best bang for the buck that I have found!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am very pleased with the life span of these batteries. I've used them on a variety of gadgets and they're still going strong.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,arrived fast. I believe one of the batteries was defective but still overall good quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Not a long life at all. I bought AA batteries in the same order and they work fine.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I bought the 20 pack in September 2015. Half of the batteries in the package do not work. Do not purchase.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I bought these batteries for my Fitbit scale and installed them as soon as they arrived. Typically I have to change the batteries every 6-8 months but I have already had to replace these. I won't be buying them again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Out of every package so far only 2 batteries are working. I bought these in April so they should still all be good and I'm finding I need to throw most of them away. I wish I could still return them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I bought these to use in the wireless mouse I bought at same time. I seem to have to change the batteries to often.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can never go wrong with Inexpensive batteries that are delivered right to your door and last just as long if not longer than the national brands. From cameras to flash lights and toys these batteries last the test of time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It is great having these around.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fabulously made product. I didn't expect excellent quality from an Amazon-branded battery. Will be purchasing more in the future. Can't beat the prices either!!!!!!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Since I have bought these batteries, I do not feel like I am changing batteries as often as I were before using Rayovak. I will say however they do not last more than a couple days of hard play on the XBOX one controllers."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I DO NOT recommend purchasing these batteries they barely last 24 hrs in what lasts 2 weeks with Costco or Duracell or Energizer brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These have a very short life. I do not recommend this brand
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They perform like name brand batteries for the cost of a smaller back of name brand batteries. Thanks.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I don't know who made these batteries but they are worthless. They do not hold a charge.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they definently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries are as described and arrived on time. I especially like the way they are sealed in packs of 4 - no worries about corrosion.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Can't go wrong. I feel like I'll be all set for AAA batteries for a while!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Such a good price and solid performance!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I found these batteries great, shipped on time, as advertized, good expiration dates, well packaged. I am puzzled by Amazon's refusing to ship more while investing what it claims are reports of problems. The reviews show overwhelmingly postive responses with 5 negative. I see Amazon happily offering many products with far worse stats. What is the story here When will the 'investigation' be over (Should the FBI be called in ) )"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I gave these battereis a perfect score because they look all right, but how can I know for sure I just got them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Never have so many done so much for so long and so little. I am a big fan of amazon basics and these batteries haven't disappointed. It is nice to have a bunch of them in the cabinet. I haven't scientifically measured the life span of them but the last long enough that I am satisfied with their quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I got these batteries for my wireless mouse, which I leave on all the time because I forget to turn it off. I don't have to change the batteries often, so they hold a decent charge."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Batteries came charged, I guess that's a good thing"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I had hoped that Amazon batteries would be as good as their other services. Unfortunately, either we got a bad batch or these batteries are not as good as other brands. These were ordered in April and it is now August and I have had to use three sets of batteries in my mouse. Normally a set of batteries lasts three or four months. I would not recommend. Others reviews are more positive, but I personally cannot recommend this brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I had ordered these because the Duracell batteries I ordered did not hold up during storage. I found that these batteries had a longer running time and so far they are holding up during storage. The Duracell batteries broke and became corroded. This is dangerous to anyone. My hope is that Amazon has higher standards and safety regulations than the Duracell plant that produced my other batteries. The Amazon batteries were packaged in four battery parcels.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I had to buy a brand new bed after purchasing this item. It kept ripping up and the bugs kept coming from the tears in the case. I do not recommend this for no one.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"It's a bunch of batteries, I have always had good luck with these batteries, All I know is you put them into the device it works"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have been purchasing batteries from Amazon for some time now, we have them in both our homes as our grandchildren seem to always have toys that need them. Amazon batteries last as long if not longer than other battery brands and they are quite a bit cheaper. Thanks Amazon"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I have been using Amazon Basics products for about 2 years and have always found them to be first rate. The batteries last as long as the name brand batteries and cost a lot less.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Delivered on time. I have been using these products for quite a while now worked great and a great deal for the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received the batteries in the silver packaging, had no issues, long battery life, etc. The second order I received the batteries in the gray packaging as pictured. I bought the second back in April, and last week I discovered that every unused battery that I hadn't used up and thrown out was leaking. I threw out 5 batteries one day, and found 3 more that were in use in remotes that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaked, and had to throw out a remote as well since it had corroded inside.I'm not going to be buying again. I could forgive one leaking battery, but almost half the package I'll either buy another brand for a bit more money and quality, or go to a local dollar store for the same quality and less money"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These seem to work out well for me. Battery checker device confirms full charge when they arrive and they last in my electronics an expected about of time. I have continued to buy and have been satisfied. They seem fresher that the store bought equivalents
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I have had these only for a week I cannot tell you anymore
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I have never been so disappointed with a product. The battery life is horrible. When used in my camera, I can get maybe five standard-non zoom pictures before the camera shuts down and states the batteries need replaced. When used in tv remotes, the battery life is maybe a week. It is the same with the Amazon AAA batteries too. I will not be repurchasing again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These do the craziest thing. I put them into stuff that needs batteries and then the thing works. Great price and quantity.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are batteries. They don't seem to last any longer or shorter than the average battery. I've bought them before and will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I have to admit I was not too happy with these and probably won't buy them again. The 'life' on them is extremely short and definitely leave a lot to be desired.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far lasting well, and I like the packaging, makes a good storage container."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I haven't really kept track meticulously but these batteries don't seem to last as long as Kirkland brand or Duracell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was buying Duracell ProCell batteries for years as the normal Duracell and Energizer batteries didn't seem to last (mostly use them in my electric shaver), but these Amazon batteries have been more impressive than the ProCell batteries. Such a bargain. I highly recommend you try the generics too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I waited until I had tried these out for awhile before I wrote this review, I read plenty of positive and negative, but for the price I desided to give them a try. I cut grass with a radio head set, I like listening to music vs. my 25hp mower engine. I've done this for several years, I usually change the batteries out about every 6 weeks, these lasted about 7 weeks. I know that's not the typical scientific review you see from some with how many volts after how many hours, but I'm just giving you a real world review, these are just as good, if not better, than the name brand batteries I purchased in the past. But a lot cheaper. Hope this helps you make your decision."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was a little hesitant to not get name brand batteries but so far the batteries I've used have been working. I like that the price is lower than elsewhere too.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I like the batteries. Seem as good as the main brands - However I do not understand why amazon has to use such wasteful packaging in a bulk box. Why pack it in sets of 4 when package is a box. It does not serve any role and just adds to landfills.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I like the heavy card board box they come in. The strength (AAA, AA, C, etc) is printed on the side of the box. This gives you the ability to stack your batteries in a common 'emergency equipment' location so you know where to go when you need one. With the plainly marked sides, you can instantly see which box you want. This will gladly replace our current system: open a package of batteries, take 1 or 2, then put the rest back - someplace. We have batteries all over the place: some in in baggies, some loose in drawers, some still in their original packaging."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries seem to be very high quality. I like the price and the packaging.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Decided to give Amazon Batteries a try...so far, so good.I've purchased them 4 times and will continue."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No issues with these batteries they work just as well (or better) than the more expensive ones I will buy again
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I've purchased several of the Amazon Basics battery. No need for a lengthy review. They work as expected and are cheap.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Iam done with Cheap Batterys,, these came holding over 1.6v,,,, on my list to buy again"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries work just as good as as other for a better price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great product!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love AmazonBasics!!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love AmazonBasics. With all the electronics devices we have in the home its nice to have a good quantity of these in the house. I would recommend amazonbasics to anyone.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"My Wife said we were out of batteries. I asked Alexa to order them and they arrived two days later. We used some immediately and they performed as expected so far. Need a little run time to verify their longevity, but I suspect they meet as advertised at least."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love buying my batteries on Amazon because they are so much cheaper and they work just as well. It's nice to always have some on hand and I don't have to worry about forgetting to buy them at the store. These batteries are of great quality and come highly recommended. Some of my friends have stopped buying batteries at the store and I've proudly converted them to the AmazonBasics batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love having a box of these. They are packed in bundles of 4. This makes them a lot less mess. They seem to last just as long as other big name brands, and are cheaper. They are in the drawer, with a box of AA and 9v. All in their own boxes and easy to grab and get some out. No more ziplock bag full of random batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As good as the copper ones for much less money. I got tired of paying through the nose for small packages of batteries at my local Wally World. It is nice to have a brick of batteries available. I actually used up half the box just getting everything stocked with new batteries. I liked them so much that I ordered the AAA and D cell boxes. As long as Amazon keeps making quality products for less money they will continue to take over the world.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love how efficiently Amaozon packages their batteries. They seem to hold up comparably to other name brand batteries. Also they are so inexpensive!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love Amazon Prime! My son needed some batteries for a device so I opened the Amazon App, voice searched for AAA batteries and about 36 hours later, I had batteries in my hand!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love the fact that you can get such a nice quantity of batteries for such a low price. Huge savings over big-box and grocery stores, and with a family of 4 kids and their army of battery-hungry toys, this deal is a life-saver."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I love the volume price, but these batteries don't seem to last as long as the Dollar General alkaline batteries I typically purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These have some major juice! I love them! Long lasting and a kick-bootie price!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great Batteries. They last a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love these
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love these batteries! This is my first time purchasing amazon batteries and am very impressed! They last very long and are super cheap! Will be ordering my batteries from amazon from now on! I have learned that anything amazon basics is great if not better than the normal name brand items. Would recommend!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love these batteries. I haven't tested them side by side, but I do not feel like I am changing them anymore frequently than the duracell we used to use, and these are less expensive."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I bought these at the same time as my AA batteries. They have a lot of power and last a long time, despite my extended use."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love these little lights! Quick and easy! Snap the batteries in, attach the double sided sticky tab on the back and place it where you need it. I actually bought them for our dog, Jynger, because she wouldn't go down the stairs to the basement doggy door at night because she couldn't see the stairs and I don't like to leave a light on all night. Works perfect! I will be buying more for other places in the house."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love these! I have them in black and the coral. Very comfortable. I wouldn't workout in them as the waistband is not snug, but do wear them around the house and when out running errands. Lightweight and wearable on warmer days."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Don't know a whole lot about batteries, but these are cheap and they work"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I keep asking my boss for AAA batteries and he always comes back with three. We have walkie-talkies at work and need these suckers by the palate. After RadioShack shut down next door, it was sort of inconvenient getting more mid-shift, and he was being stingy, so I finally just bought a box and dropped it on his desk. Think he gets it now."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I need to cancel this auto shipment
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I needed batteries for my kittens toys. The first three I used lasted only 5 hours!! I am so unhappy, I spent 8 which is a lot of money for me."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I never knew Amazon had such good value on batteries! We use these for everything from remotes to Xbox one Controllers.They seem to last as long as any other name brand battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,They do not last at all! I never leave negative reviews as I am generally satisfied. But logged back in just to do it! They are awful!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I never tested them for output, but based on experience they appear to work just as well as any other batteries we purchased in past, and price is better"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I normally buy the Maxwell brand but thought I'd give these a try. I used them in my led battery operated lights, they were dead in half the time of the Maxwells."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I originally wanted to buy Duracell brand batteries but I bought these instead (Aug. 2016) as they were cheaper. I just today had to remove a set of these from a remote thermometer and they had leaked even though the date printed on the batteries was Jan. 2025. My savings on these cheaper batteries was far less than the cost of my now damaged thermometer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I purchased these batteries for my boyfriend . The split open and ruined who uses them in a 200.00 portable modem. I would of sent them back, but this happened after the 30 day return window."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I purchased these for my daughter for camp and open a pack today and they did not work. Fresh out of the plastic wrap and everything:(.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I purchased these for the office as everyone has an Apple mouse that uses AA batteries. I found myself changing batteries on my mouse almost every month with these batteries. Yes they work, but not for long. We purchased these in September and we blew through these in 2.5 months with 16 employees. With Duracell batteries, which I purchased again, they last much longer, several months instead of just one month."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I put several of these in my mouse battery and had to replace them after only a few days. Will not be buying more.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The price was right and now I have to wait and see how long these batteries will last. I read some good reviews on this product but I have yet to render a final decision.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I really like Amazon batteries. I think they work just as well as any of the other brands, but at a much better price point."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Never enough of these in the house. I really like the bulk purchase and have them handy option.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I really like these AA Performance Alkaline Batteries. They last longer. We use these in our grandsons remote control cars and they last much longer than some of the other brands that we've purchased in the past..
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I received a lot of batteries for very inexpensive. This is the best deal on batteries I've ever found
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're perfect and I have to mention the price is great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have ordered these twice now. Every gadget and game my son has seems to need AA batteries. I can't give technical info about their capabilities compared to others, but I can say I did not go through them any faster than the name brand sets. The biggest battery sucker in our house being video game controllers. They seem to last at least as long, perhaps slightly longer. I recommend for the average user."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I haven't noticed any different between these batteries and Duracell or Energizer. Perhaps they're lasting a little longer. I recommend this product!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was hesitant to buy anything but the big name brands in batteries. I took a chance for the value in Amazon batteries and I have been pleasantly surprised! I should have bought this a long time ago.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I still have not found an alkaline battery that outlasts a Duracell, but for the price, these are hard to beat. They've managed quite well in both an LED lamp and a wireless computer mouse. I'll be purchasing them again, for sure."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Until lately 99 of the AA and AAA batteries I bought were Duracell brand. Its not that Ive found any brand to be that much better or that much worse than another but I tend to stick with what works for me. And for those things that I use disposable batteries in (I try to use rechargeables whenever I can) Duracells seem to work out the best. And they are the brand that the membership store sells so I can get them at a reasonable price whenever Im shopping for supplies.I took a chance on buying Amazon Basics brand for a couple of reasons. One is that Ive had good luck with the Amazon Basics brand I dont think Amazon is going to mess up their reputation selling junk. One strong factor is that these claim to be made in Japan, and Japanese-made batteries from Panasonic, Sony, Maxell and other major name brands have a good reputation. But the 1 reason I tried these is price. They are 10-15 cents less PER BATTERY than what Ive been buying and it doesnt make sense to me to pay more if Im not getting any more.These have an overall feeling and look of being made pretty well. Its easy to spot a cheap no-name battery and these are definitely better. They are bulk packed, which is great, why pay more for fancy packaging on something as mundane as a battery And theyre fresh you know thats going to be true with Amazons immense daily turnover of product. If you are reading the reviews, be aware that Amazon has been making regular upgrades to this battery, so something reviewed a year ago is probably long obsolete by now. The biggest change I understand is the shelf life of the newest formulation is now rated at 10 years. I dont really care, theres no way a box of batteries is going to sit on my shelf for 10 years but it does mean that when I get to the 48th battery out of a package of 48 it probably will be nearly as fresh as the first one in the pack.I havent been able to see any downsides, and I do like saving money that would be wasted for fancy packaging and expensive advertising, so unless something drastically changes I believe these will now be my brand of choice."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Don't seem to last long. I think dollar general batteries are just as good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I have purchased other Amazon Basics batteries. These are my first AA's. They work just like the other ones do. I am not an electrical engineer so I can't give you an engineering report. All I can tell you is that I like them. I like buying batteries in large quantities and I like that they come in a nice box for storage.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I think these batteries are better than the ones I would buy at the store. Better quality but also better price for the amount. I bought these AAA and the AA.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I've tried a lot of different batteries for my headlamps and they seem to last the longest and have the lowest price on a per battery basis. I have been using the Amazon batteries for about six months now. I guess the battery can never last as long as I think it should last so I gave it the four stars for that reason.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I used to get the Sony bulk package of the AA batteries but when I saw this deal I couldn't pass it up without giving it a try. I use a lot of batteries with my 3 dslr flashes triggers so this is a great deal for me
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I use batteries for low drain electronics like hand held GPS. Tested these against Duracell copper tops and was surprised that the Amazon Basics last longer than Duracell. 24 hours vs 21. Not a huge difference but they are 1/2 the price:)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I use LOTS of batteries and these are the best bargain out there. Seem to last as long as Duracell and much longer than the other major name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Cheap AAA batteries! Haven't had any issue with them so far, I use them in stuff like... my nose hair trimmer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I use these for all the remotes in my house. They're competitively priced and hold a charge as well as any others I've purchased. Definitely my go-to battery of choice now.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I use these on my Xbox one controllers. For the price they are quite a steal. I haven't really noticed a difference in battery life over other batteries. They get the job done, and I will definitely be using these batteries for the foreseeable future"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I use this mostly for my thermostat and it seems to last me about 3 weeks or so. I kind of expected it to last at least a month.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I haven't heard any complaints of longevity or strength from the teens who use them for video gaming controllers. They seem to be comparable to the other name brands and dutifully serve their purpose. I used a couple in our favorite dancing decor for Halloween. It's been a month and Frankenstein is still shaking his hips like the first day I put the batteries in.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I used them for christmas decoration and by the end of christmas the batteries leaked . will not get them again
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I used these batteries with my LED lights. It works but it doesn't last long. I used Duracell batteries the same price last much longer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Never disappointed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was a little hesitant to order these because they were not a name brand. I was actually really pleased with how they work. They seem like they last as long as any of the name brands, and definitely more superior to any other bulk batteries. I thought the price was very reasonable."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I was hoping these batteries would last more than 4 hours, and since they didn't I don't think the price should be as listed"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is not my first time to buy these batteries. I was pleasantly surprised to find these as good or better in longevity of battery life to Duracell. I would recommend these to anyone and I will seek these out over other brands when available.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was surprised how good these batteries are. Very fresh. I bought other sizes also. Very happy with all of them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I would have gotten the same quality had I got batteries from the dollar store. I was very disappointed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries are affordable and they last as long as any of the expensive ones. So why pay more !
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I will never purchase this item again. It is in my opinion overpriced junk.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,DID NOT LAST LONG
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I will update my review when I see how long they really last but I gave it 5 stars for price and fast delivery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries do not last nearly as long as the bunny or copper brands. I will use them up and never waste my time or money on these again. I have been using them in an LED flashlight.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,i won't buy batteries from home depot etc. anymore because these are equal quality to the well known brands and they are much cheaper and don't require sawing through plastic to open.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I see that these batteries have lots of positive reviews. My experience has been poor. I put a pair in the sensor for an outdoor thermometer. They lasted about 2 weeks and when tested, showed very low power. Replaced them with a second pair. They lasted and tested about the same. These may work better in indoor uses, but they seem to not like the cold. I've had way better success with rechargeable."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These batteries hold a charge well. I have used the generation of batteries before these (the green ones) for many years in my computer mouse and keyboard and my camera flash. I would image these would be as good or better.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I primarily use these for my noise cancelling headphones and wireless mouse. Overall, for the price, this is an okay product. I do not get the longevity I received when buying other brands, but for the price and quantity it seems to all equal out. I would not recommend using them for vital devices nor rely on them in emergencies."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works as intended. I would recommend!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Wish I had opened the package all the way as soon as I received it because several of the batteries had leaked and caused corrosion on several more. Learned one this time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"They're not a bad value (because they're cheap), but they drain much faster than you would like. I hate throwing dead batteries away anyway (no recycling options here) and 4 of these drained in a day, running a tiny string of LED Christmas lights."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Batteries are decent. I wouldn't consider them better than Duracell or Energizer but the price is right.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I needed batteries, this was an incredible deal. Normally I would buy only Duracell, but these will do the job, and they aren't Energizer or Rayovac. As long as they last for more than a few months, I'll be happy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice batteries, without the famous name brands or high price..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I am very impressed with Amazon batteries. I use them in flashlights, and my latest test - the toilet bowl night light (search for it on Amazon and you'll see what I'm talking about). This thing eats up batteries very quickly! But the Amazon batteries last well over 1 month, when Duracell, Energizer and other top brands hardly last 1 month. I'll definitely order Amazon batteries for all sizes and keep a good supply in the house."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I'm appreciative of those reviewers who have actually tested the voltage of these batteries, which definitely impacted me in buying them. I primarily bought these because they are cheap. I've got a handful of wireless keyboards/mice that use AA batteries and go through them pretty quickly. The batteries came easily packaged (in 4's within a box) and they work as described. I don't store batteries for long periods of time so I don't think I'll ever (possibly) encountering leaking issues."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Fast delivery. Good value!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon alkaline batteries are terrific! I've bought and used the AA AAA ones. I must say that they are just as good if not better than Energizer and Duracell, which I used to only use those. Not anymore!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I miss the bunny with the drum.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'm 100 satisfied with this pack of AA Amazon Basics batteries. I definitely would buy more in the future. I like the way the batteries are stacked in a simple organized box. Nice.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works like a charm-m-m
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I'm confident that the batteries are good, but the packaging is less than convenient. Price can't be beat.1. The sticker on the battery cardboard package was quite hard to pull off. 2. The tab that opens the package was so tight that I had to pry it with a table knife. 3. After all that struggle I still had to cut away tight plastic on two packs of batteries! I'm used to my batteries in a plastic case/dispenser. This was an ordeal!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great so far...no bad apples in my batch.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What can a person say about alkaline batteries They work or they don't. I'm happy with the performance. It would take some really carefully planned load testing to compare the performance with other brands. They seems just as good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These batteries work just as they should and only cost a fraction of the price of regular ones. I'm happy with them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Quality product. Corresponding description. I'm happy. Thank seller.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These last just as long as the name brand. Will be buying these from now on. Price is a lot better too.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I'm impressed worth the life of these batteries, still going strong after printing 3 cartridges worth of labels on my dymo labeler."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They don't last quite as long as regular batteries but long enough to still save money. I'm pleased with these batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I don't notice any difference between these batteries and premium brand name ones They seem to last just as long, and at a great price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I can't believe how low price these batteries are compared to in-store batteries. I've been using Amazon's batteries for a couple years and they work just as well and long as duracell and like brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I've had good luck with Amazon basics peripheral devices for computers, but the 24 pack of AAA batteries I got had virtually no power out of the package. Perhaps it's a quality control issue, but I got burned on the ones I bought, and won't take another chance with them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love it when Amazon brings out commonly used products under their own name that perform well and are priced right. These AAA batteries are just another example of Amazon's buying power and smart branding. Because why would any company put their name (and reputation) on a product if they weren't convinced that it would be a true value to consumers The last thing that they want consumers to do is identify Amazon with anything but quality.So buy these knowing that they are a good value and work properly. And if for some reason you get a bad batch--which can happen to anyone--simply return them under their return policy and get a replacement box.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I've used these exclusively for my two Xbox One controllers and have not tried any other batteries in them. They lasted for about 48 hours of play time before running out. That seemed quick to me but I don't have anything to compare it to. These were the right price. I will order again when I remember to order batteries before I need them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack)If anyone tells you that all batteries are the same, don't believe them. I worked in a battery manufacturing plant for 13 years. I can tell you that while they are made from the same ingredients and in the same way the power output is not the same. Because I know some about batteries then I can tell you that I like the quality of these batteries. I can't tell you how they are tested or at what point a battery is rejected but I can tell you that there are only certain types of batteries that I will buy because I don't believe in throwing away money and I Amazon batteries are right up there with my other 2 brands. I plan to continue to keep a supply of Amazon Batteries on hand at all times. You should too. You just can't beat the quality and the ease to purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"If you are like me with a remote control for this and another one for that, not to mention battery powered clocks, etc. you can go thru a lot of AA batteries. These I can say have held up well with no problems of corrosion, rust or diminished longevity and buying in bulk makes for a better buy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These are OK. Used to Rayovacs to save but, these cost the same and seem to last about 3/4 as much as the other brand. Mostly used for Xbox controllers and Mac mice/keyboard."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,thank you amazon for being clued into our needs and offering generic prices of things like batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Yup, they're batteries alright. But here's the cool thing: they're made by AMAZON! Amazon manufactures excellent quality products (think Costco/Kirkland), and their products cost so much less than comparable products from other manufacturers. I could see Amazon get into manufacturing everything, even cars and trucks, and taking over the world, and I'd be remarkably okay with that."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good quality and price for families who have little kids (and lots of toys that constantly need new batteries!)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fantastic deal for a ton of batteries.I've noticed these last an impressive amount of time - I still cannot believe how much of a ripoff store batteries are!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What is there to say about batteries They provide good power and are just as good as any other brand I have purchased.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Pretty much works well, I'm just using these batteries for regular stuff things. So far no damage and it was deliver in less than 2 week so that was good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"AA batteries are expensive, help is at Amazon."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,if you use batteries like I do I would recommend these. Much cheaper than buying locally and just as good if not better
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Each battery only lasts a few days on my wireless mouse.Update: the problem is actually with my mouse or computer other batteries are also draining too fast. Nevertheless, it would be good if these Amazon batteries stated their capacity."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,In clocks and light load these batteries work good. In something that draws more power like a hand-held labeler they do not live long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,In my greatest time of need these batteries saved the moment I have been waiting for. It was a Monday but not just any Monday. I was getting ready to watch my favorite show. But when i went to turn on my tv my remote died. All I needed was four AAA batteries I thought all was lost then. Then I heard a knock on my door alas it was the mailman and he had these magnificent batteries. I could watch my show! Five stars five stars by god these batteries deserve it!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Dont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Relatively inexpensive (I guess the multiplack of Kirkland batteries sold by Costco would be cheaper, but I didn't want to buy a ton of these, I needed them quickly and they were delivered right to my Mom's house in two days....well worth it), and they seem to work well...only time will tell if they hold up in the Fulcrum 30010-301 LED Battery-Operated Stick-On Tap Light, Silver, 3 Pack I purchased along with them"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"20 batteries for 8 bucks is cheap. You won't find that even at Costco. Hopefully, they will last."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Not much to say about batteries. They are inexpensive and work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Have no problem using these batteries. Seem to last a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent bought a case of these - something like 156 batteries - and threw them into LED flashlights. Work fantastically, packaged well, and inexpensive. But that's Amazon Basics products."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Work fine but I have had a couple start leaking in less than a month. Worried this may happen while in electronics.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Interesting batteries. Felt tip marked the date. We'll see if they hold up against the competition.Batteries arrived in just a couple of days.Spam arrived, too. Lots of it. Did not click on the links, but forwarded the spam to stop-spoofingamazon.com. It finally stopped."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,received quickly with n o damages. This battery seems to be the same as all the other ones.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can't beat a great price on a ton of batteries. They are holding up like the name brands so far. I love Amazon basics. I just love everything Amazon really!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"It felt like opening a box of bullets.Decent power, great for using in my photography equipment. Plus, I don't feel bad about tossing them after a day's use."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Lot of cells. It got great reviews so the price was right!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,The batteries work well for the price. It is a good valve
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I can never have too many batteries - so many little things from remotes to flashlights. It is great to know I don't have to rake through drawers looking for batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,It stopped working. Never buy this. It's not certified by Apple. Not sure why Amazon is selling such products on prime
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It was a very quick delivery and an excellent product. All batteries measure a bit over 1.5 volts and have perfect packaging.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Price is right, but doesn't seem to hold as long of a charge as some of the other name brand batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,There... There batteries. It would be pretty hard to screw this one up
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,IT'S A BATTERY
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I have yet to be disappointed by an Amazon Basics product, to me a battery is a battery it's the cost I look at. These were the lowest cost per battery on the site."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,C'mon it's batteries they work they were a good price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I mean, it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Inexpensive, it's a good buy!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They don't last as Duracell or Energizer. For the price, it's a good buy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,battery life is comparable to other more well-known brands! It's a great deal and a great product!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They work, they're cheap, they come in annoying shrink wrapping."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fine good price. It's a battery what can I say.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheap batteries for my TI-83 graphing calculator. Way cheaper than other brands and does what it's suppose to do.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It's nice to be able to order the batteries you are going to need right from Amazon so they arrive with your products
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,It's what you would expect from a good battery. Really not a lot to say. Expiration date was good. Another dependable Amazon product!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Item as described.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I purchased this item to use in the microphones in our church. Product is just what I expected and it works great. Price was good also.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Its a battery nothing much to say. I usually buy at costco but the convenience of the free delivery was the decision breaker this time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Lights worked well but the ahesive didnt stick on about 90 of the lights backing. The 10 that did. I tried to adjust the lights and they ripped.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We get alot of batteries on Amazon, its a good price and I have never had them leak as others have"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries work but don't really last that long. You maybe get 3-4 weeks out of them. Its better off buying rayovac or energizer batteries from home depot
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No better way to get ready for lots of gaming like bulk batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries for an excellent price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries are junk . i use 4 of them in my front door lock. i have gone through 12 batteries in less than a month .
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Batteries used in fire remote, lasted maybe a week and then died"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"batteries suck! brand new out of box dead or close too. Change smoke alarms every month and remote batteries every 2 weeks.junk dead, 3 different boxes and sizes of amazon"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Absolute junk! My devices run only 3 - 5 days with these batteries and probably half have been dead when I put them in my devices. Save your money buy Duracell batteries from Groupon they will stand behind less than quality batteries but Amazon will not once you buy Amazon batteries as has become the case with most of Amazon you are on your on without a paddle.Amazon did send me replacement batteries however they are the same as the original ones. I don't know how anyone can give a positive review just terrible.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,it's a good deal for the price but I don't seem to get much longevity out of them. I'm not done with them and will actually match them up against other batteries and will update.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These batteries are just adequate not super strong as advertised.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They seem to work as well as the others I was buying at Costco. Haven't done in depth testing like some others here, but they work reasonably well for us."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just as expected. We used them for the lazer tag guns and they guns are still going strong after two weeks of constant use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Just as good as leading brands, but alot cheaper. Will be buying more in the future."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work just as well as the brand names
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries. Arrived just in time
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What can I say - they work and last just as good as any other brand I have tried. I bought various sizes from Amazon and they all work great - just make sure you buy in advance to have them on hand for when you need them instead of running to the store forking over a lot more money for the same performance - I did buy the 9 volt box to replace all my fire alarms in the house - PERFECT!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Absolute best value for standard batteries (especially when using subscribe and save). If you aren't seeking rechargeable, I haven't ever been able to distinguish any real difference in quality or longevity between these and other top brands of batteries (Duracell, Energizer, etc.).Between my kids toys and my Xbox controllers, we go through about all of these batteries in about 6 months, so subscribe and save is the way to go."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"let's face it batteries can be stupid expensive. I usually buy top name brand batteries but, after reading some reviews I decided to try amazons brand. I will say I think they are just as good as any top brand battery. I am very happy with the quality and life span of the amazons brand battery and will continue to buy them. Thanks."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We go through a lot of batteries in my house. I have found that the Amazon Basics batteries last just as long as the Energizer I normally buy and the price is so much better.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was very skeptical of buying a not very well known brand of battery. We have a lot of toys and go through a lot of batteries .As far as I can tell just as good and lasts just as long as more expensive name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seems to be just as good as the name brand batteries. Haven't had issues with any yet.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are great! I purchased these because I was interested in trying the Amazon brand batteries. In comparison to other batteries these batteries weigh about the same as other name brand batteries and they last just as long. Only difference is you save money by buying these! I'm sold on these amazon brand batteries and I will continue to purchase these in the future and I will recommend them to family and friends.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work great. No complaints.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I might even say they're better than name brand based on the price and quantity you get. Use them in everything from kids toys to flashlights to gaming controllers.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Bought these for our camping trip to use in lanterns. Lasted just as long, if not longer than name branded ones."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just as good as the big name brands...excellent value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I haven't seen any difference in how long these last versus paying more for Energizer and Duracel. They are a bargain and to me batteries are almost the same no matter what as long as they are good cells and stable. I'll keep buying these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"For the price, these can't be beat. I don't have scientific measurements, but these seem to last just as long in my mouse, keyboard, remote, etc. as the more expensive brands do, for a lot cheaper. I like having a lot on hand so that I don't run out and have to pay more for them at the store, so I order these in bulk in different sizes and I'm always prepared. Overall, I've had really good luck with the Amazon brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great buy!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I started using Amazon Basics Batteries several months ago in my flameless candles, flashlights, computer mouse, remotes, basically anything that requires AA batteries. These batteries work every bit as well and last as long as any name-brand batteries I've tried, at a much more reasonable price point. I like the convenience of the large economy packs, delivered promptly to my door. Way to go, Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Just as good as the name brand ones I get at the store. LOVE buying batteries at Amazon, it's SO much cheaper!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good Batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These seem to be every bit as good as the name brands. Have used them in many applications.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fine batteries for general use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Who would have thought amazon batteries could compete with the other top brands. They definitely serve their purpose and I will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries, very comparable to all the top name brands, but at a much better price!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work just like any other top brand battery out there. These batteries are not the low voltage batteries that you might've accidentally purchased because you were thinking you were getting such a good deal. Great batteries for a great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Batteries worked well, just as well as the store bought ones but at a better price"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I think my favorite thing is that they come in the convenient box. Keeps my junk drawer a lot neater without having batteries rolling around or stuck in baggies. Otherwise, they're just batteries. I haven't noticed any difference from the duracells and energizers I used to use."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"A nice size bulk pack of AAA batteries. Beats the prices of what walmart or target has. These are NOT rechargeable, seen some people asking if they were in the question box. Will do just fine for remotes, flash lights, kids toys etc."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These come packaged into 4's, love that! I bought them specifically for the emergency lanterns I got and since they are packed separated into 4's I can put them with the lanterns perfectly. They work great and have had ZERO problems with these. Definitely recommend!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I haven't done any scientific research on how long these last compared to other batteries, I can only give you my layman's experience. I use the exact same amount of battery usage every day and have tried pretty much every brand of battery (I don't hear that well so I wear headphones for my television and I wear them the same number of hours per day).The AmazonBasics batteries don't last nearly as long as any other battery. My headphones start getting fuzzy about twelve hours earlier than they normally would with any other the batteries I've ever used. I went through this package a week earlier than I would a 24-pack of either Duracell or Energizer. In some usages this might not matter but for me, it just wasn't worth it to buy these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good deal. Good battery. No complaints.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seem to last just as long as any other major brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"What can you say about batteries They work and are very reasonable. Amazon prime means no shipping cost. I haven't done any comparison between these and other brands.But then, I have a life to live."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Performs well, inexpensive, A++"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best Deal for the price of what you need
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries holds up ,just like the big name brands ....use them in my radio ,remotes..they last a long time ...sure glad I bought them before I get the higher price ones"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Great for small gadgets and remotes. Don't expect to run anythinh more. Could handle a set of battery power hair clippers.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I bought these but will not reorder. They work but seem to go flat rather quickly.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,do not seem to last as long as other batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Loved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls. I like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but I might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"these are okay, not as good as Energizer, but cheaper"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,The life of these batteries is shorter than name brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Compared to other AA Battery types these take the cake! I just LOVE these AmazonBasics Batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just received these today and they are dated 11/2026 so the performance brand truly has a ten year shelf life. I've had about the same performance from these amazons as with regular duracells recently. For the price I couldn't ask for anything more.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great quality and super cheap! What else you can ask for
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just right. Quick shipping/adequate packing/as pictured described!! Thanks so much!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries light up my life! Well at least my TV and my kids turtle night light. My world would be so dark and lonely without them. The right price brought happiness to our world
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Now my robot army will never run out of power again MUAHAHAHAHAHA!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just what I wanted.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love Amazon basics. Useful products at good prices.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far. So good. Appears to perform as well as the national brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Just like brand name, but cheap and convenient"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Cheap AAA batteries. Really shouldnt expect much, just wish they would last as long as comparably priced batteries. I use them for the light i wear on my head at work. Typical AAAs last 6-8 hours constant use, these last about 3-4."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They seem to work well. We use them in all our electronics that call for it. Never had a problem and they seem to last as long as other brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are great batteries for the price! I use them for my Xbox controllers. I game a lot and I use 2 batteries a week or so.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good product,fair price, handy quantity for household, great shopping experience. Thanks"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Grandkids and toys rather says it all. These are long-lasting and at a good price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries at a great price, what's not to like"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries work well, kids love having the battery stash for toys, can't beat the Amazon price on these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great bang for you buck on AA batteries. Will be buying again when and if we ever run out LOL!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These don't last like good batteries. But are a great price. If you have kids that leave toys on and run out batteries then these are good. I don't use them in the remote or anything I want to rely on for long term use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I purchased a box of these. First replacement for my outdoor weather info transmitter didn't work so well. Within a couple of days the receiver wasn't receiving a signal from the transmitter, so I changed out the batteries once again. Within 96hrs the receiver once again showed low battery power coming from the transmitter and wouldn't display a temperature reading. This week I'll replace those again (3rd time in 6wks) and expect a low-battery warning just days after. Unsure if I should demand an exchange or full reimbursement. Maybe they do well in warm temps, but in the cold temps they cannot perform like a Duracell or Energizer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Decent price for the grand kid's toys. Last a good time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These have worked really well. I've had these batteries for a few months, and I don't think any of the items that I have used that required batteries have died yet. Hoping the batteries continue to work for awhile longer. It is really nice have a large supply of batteries especially since these last so long!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. If they weren't considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you'll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they're really not worth your time"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work great and last and much better price then store.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We were tired of buying expensive batteries and these work perfectly. They're not super light weight like some of the other brands so you can tell they're of equal quality to the name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We've been going through a lot of AAA sized batteries and have been able to verify that these Amazon Basics batteries last just as long as other name brand alkaline batteries from Duracell, Rayovac or energizer in low and steady drain devices. Due to the price advantage we will keep using these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,they are batteries at a low price how can you go wrong.We go threw a lot of batteries in my house and I am sick of running out of them . soi signed up for a reaccuring of these.they are cheaper then big box stores.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love these batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Everyone debates how long batteries last and these work perfectly fine. As a college student who spends a ton of time playing Xbox, my roomates and I went through batteries by the dozen and were always short. Instead of taking them out of any device we coud get our hands on (remotes, calculators, etc) we decided to just get these in bulk. They are much cheaper than getting anything in store and last long enough that we didnt notice a difference. A pair in an Xbox 360 controller lasted a good 4 months with almost daily use which is better than most batteries in my opinion."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Last just as long or longer than the name brands! I game alot and have been using Duracell or energizer, whichever is on sale. Decided to try these and so far I feel like they have lasted longer than the name brands. Ill update if this changes"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"My go to batteries. Good battery life with these, and they cost so little"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought some over a year ago and I still have a couple of packets of 4. Gonna get some more soon
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work just as good as higher priced batteries. We go through tons of AA's in our home so I did the subscribe and save which saves us some money and gives me one less thing to remember to grab every month or two.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,First time trying the Amazon batteries and glad I did. These batteries have out lasted the Duracell batteries we used before and are cheaper! Will definitely purchase again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Last longer than any Alkaline I have purchased. Performance Alkaline Batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Affordable batteries that last longer than Duracell!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Much better than big name brands!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Literally. Bought these in May and they JUST ran out. These are great batteries (F the specs, I'll leave that to battery specialists. But these lasted way longer and better than a Plug and Play. Minus the cord when the battery died. Bought these again. Can't beat the price of effectiveness."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Lasted an average amount of time for batteries that I normally use in my Xbox controllers. Definitely worth the price tho.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Lasted ten minutes in my flashlight. Changed out the batteries again, the next two lasted 12 minutes. Don't buy. Junk!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Two batteries came with my amazon basics mouse i bought. I was suprised that it took two years for them to die. Definitely buying again, highly recommend."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"No complaints, so far the batteries are lasting as they should for batteries of this size."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Like Duracell
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"With several kids, we go through a lot of batteries for toys games. So many, in fact, that I have kept them on my monthly subscribe save. Previous to trying the Amazon Basic brand I had used Duracell Maxell. As both of the former increased their prices, I decided to try the Amazon brand. I actually expected a generic performance but was happily mistaken when they lasted as long as the name brands One of my children is special needs and has an electronic keyboard that uses 6 AA batteries. With Duracell, we got about 15 hours of use, Maxell was about 14.5 and with Amazon Basic I am getting just over 15. AmazonBasics are my new battery brand"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was very surprised when the package arrived. These are AA batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"An alkaline battery is an alkaline battery, no matter whose brand name is on it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Awesome for the price. Lasts as long as the name brands
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Pretty impressed at how much longer these last than regular name brand. I will never spend money on top notch batteries after using these. These last way longer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Grabbed these fairly cheap and didn't expect much. I use these for my Xbox one controllers and have only gone through 2 sets so far. This pack looks like it will last some time until I pick up a rechargeable battery pack. Beats your dollar store batteries by a mile.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fast shipping. Amazon basics last longer too. Been buying them for awhile
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Way great battery! I love em. Cheap and last forever.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Do not buy each have leaked within one recharge. Battery corrosion at base ruined my battery recharger as well. Warranty for 30 days. You can't use them all and recharge within 30 days
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Two batteries of he the twenty were leaking in the Package on delivery. With a ten year warranty against leakage...that is not a good start
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Half the box did not work and one set of 4 started leaking white battery acid within 5 minutes of putting it my sons toy. Asking Amazon for a full refund.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I've kept a stock of these batteries for about a year (in a drawer in my living room) and used them in my air freshener with no problems. However, when I used them with my Pawbo toy (it's a remote cat toy), not only do they not last very long, but I just went to replace the batteries and saw that were leaking after only a day!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Maybe we have a bad batch because all the other Amazon Basics batteries we have are great.. So far numerous AA batteries are leaking in remotes, toys, and other electronics."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,After 2nd recharge and use all but 3 are leaking corrosive fluid which has ruined my charger.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I bought this product from amazon about a month ago, the reviews seemed great so I gave them a try.After using the batteries in my Xbox One controllers for about 2 weeks, the controller began to malfunction.Upon further inspection, I checked the batteries, and the compartment was a little bit wet, so I cleaned it up and went to get new batteries (still in the plastic wrapper) and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them (some type of leakage) .Overall, dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries are the worst of any I've ever bought. They have corroded inside of toys, remotes, noise cancelling range headphones and an expensive gun scope that I own. I've tried AA and AAA, and even gave them multiple chances. The batteries in some electronic devices die within 24hrs. So needless to say, I have switched back to standard Duracell batteries. If you care about life and not having to mess with corrosion, do not buy these batteries!!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These night lights are worthless. They do not work as described on Amazon.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"To me, a battery is a battery is a battery. These were cheaper and I thought they worked just fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries don't seem inferior to the more expensive Duracells and Energizer that we have been using. We have been using these primarily to go in our XBox One controllers, and they last a few weeks to a month with pretty consistent use, about the same as other AAs we have used. The price can't be beat, even cheaper than Costco at the time of purchase and with free shipping in hassle free packaging."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I just wanted to comment that I feel the individual 4-pack packaging is unnecessary. I personally don't have anything that takes four batteries. Several twos and a lot of threes. I'd prefer a box full of loose batteries rather than having to search around for a knife to cut free what I need.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Never had alkalines that die as fast. This has been consistent through the package, not just a couple of batteries. Same results when used in TV remotes, optical mouse, smoke detectors and small flashlights."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Life span long...performance upto satisfaction. Reliable. No failure. Only performance.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries works great. Bought the 48 pack for basic essentials around the house, such as clocks, remotes, wireless mouse keyboards, etc."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Well, you know...these are batteries. They work....like batteries. Great price and I see no difference in their performance or duration compared to bigger brand batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"No issues so far. Like the way they are packaged, very economical and space saving."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We always use these batteries and they work as well an Duracell for a lot less. We will continue to buy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works well, good price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,liked it
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,The batteries linked and ruined my Game Camera. I think you need to replace my game Camera
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works both lights working with power
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I purchased a box of 48 AA batteries and the first 2 that I tried to use were dead the other 2 in the blister 4 pack worked fine, but a 50 failure rate is unacceptable. I will update how the rest of the box works as I try to use them. I will purchase a name brand next time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,always happy with the amazon basics batteries as they live up to expectations and the price is right
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries seem to work as well as other brands at a much better price point.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Might be okay. But, they seem cheap. They have warm light (orangeish in color). They have the feeling that they might only last a year or too, and not multiple Christmas seasons. We are doing a timer test and have one that does not want to follow the standard timer. Also, the window suction cup things are to small for these candles. They will ultimately work, but are going to be stretched to do so. Picture is of the loan gunmen candle (screw the built of n timer!!!)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Good knob. Looks good. Logo faded/wore off in a few months though... logo is kinda why I bought this, so.........."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Purchased at a decent price and haven't noticed any difference from any other batteries I have used. Long as you can get them at a decent price I'd definitely recommend.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Incredible deal for this prices, the batteries are long duration nice!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"2nd time purchasing these battteries. They last a long time in everything i have put them into, baby toys,remotes,game controllers etc. Just as good as the name brand or better, Zer0 Complaints!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good quality, long lasting."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for the price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I bought these to use in wireless microphones at my church. The receivers have battery strength meters built in, so I know when it's time to replace the batteries. These batteries last longer than the brand name I had previously been using."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love getting these batteries delivered through subscribe and save. I'm never out of batteries anymore. It was a constant battle with my family to hunt down batteries and to remember to buy them at the store. They also seem to be long lasting.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Long Lasting and nice.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Long lasting, reusable packaging."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Reviewers aren't wrong.The Amazon Basics Performance batteries are long lasting. My grand kids go through a lot of batteries with the toys I keep for them. Buying them locally costs a fortune! These larger packages of the Amazon Basics make the price per battery so delightful. And they last with good power for a long time!Thank goodness for Amazon, and for their brand!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are as good as any batteries you buy in the stores.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are really long lasting. I use them for my Xbox one and I haven't had to change one pair yet. It does the job well
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries lasted a surprisingly long time. With all the remotes for the gaming consoles we use we've just gotten to the last 4 and it's been over 2 months. Super impressed!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries seem to last as long as the name brands you would purchase at the store. I have saved a lot of money by buying these in bulk instead of running to the store every time I need batteries. I am happy with these and will probably order more when I run out.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These truly are long lasting I'd had them in my game remote and they last longer than the name brand definitely would repurchase
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They last like regular high end batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"If you're looking for cheap but durable batteries look no further. I personally like amazon products. I know I can count on them as much as a named brand, but for a 1/4 of the price. I got these on Prime day for a great price and the last a OK amount of time. I used them on my xbox controller, but i think it soaked up more power than I thought so the batteries died with in a month or so. Its not like I keep track, but noticing the controller shutting off was what lead me on to the life of the batteries. I have enough to last me a year or so. Again, good buy. If you're looking to save money from the expensive name brands, go with a Amazon brand product its becoming more common and competitive as a name brand product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries work just as well as Duracell or whatever other name brand you can find at the stores. Long lasting and great quality. Will buy agian.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Better than any other battery we've tried. Long lasting and inexpensive.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Long lasting and nice. Does not heat up or lose charge while on high heat or very harsh cold temperature. It is also very cheap!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I needed some AAA's and decided to go with these since I no longer have an acive COstco membership. So far these batteries have held up very well in my remotes, several headlamps, and tactical flashlights that I regularly use. Great purchase"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great long lasting batteries. I ordered these to use in an LED book light. I have also installed them in a small flashlight. The Amazon batteries last at least twice as long as a the value brand I had been using in my book light. Good value, good performance."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries! Long-lasting. Great value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I find these batteries last longer than Duracell. I use it on small light that stays on for 4 hours 5 nights a week. Great product from Amazon.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works better than any name brand I have ever used.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Outstanding value. Long lasting. I have now switched all of my battery purchases over to Amazon Basics (AA, D, 9V, AAA) I haven't experienced a bad battery in the whole lot."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Much cheaper and long lasting than most bargain brands. We use them in Xbox/Wii controllers mostly.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love!! Exactly what I paid for. It came in a nice cardboard package and I use it as a storage for the unused batteries. I've had these for months and the first pair are still going strong. I'm very happy with my purchase.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love the long life at a great price . I use these daily and compared to the big brands works just as well
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seem to have a great life to them. I'm impressed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These batteries last a long time and does not leak even after it runs out of juice. I use these to power my remotes and nightlights and have not experienced any problem whatsoever with it.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We used these batteries in digital microphone packs for our production of Fiddler on the Roof (a long musical, btw). I wasn't sure if they would last through the performance, since digital microphones use up more power as they are always searching for a signal. The AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline batteries did not disappoint. I used Energizer MAXX (30 more power) in a couple of the microphone packs, and they died out before the show was over. The AmazonBasics had juice to spare! I will purchase these from now on. More power for almost half the cost!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Longest lasting batteries I've ever used. I bought them for my Xbox One controllers which I used for hours at a time every day and I replace batteries maybe once every couple weeks.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seem good quality. Will update after seeing how they last.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Same for these AA batteries as for the AAA batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Great batteries! I have nothing negative I can say about this product. They work just as well as any name brand product you would buy off the shelf at any store except these are probably one quarter of the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Put these in our candles on November 25. They are in for 8 hours every night. As of Jamuary 17 almost all of them are still going!!!!!!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Lot of batteries for the price and the seem to work just as well as any name brands I have tried in the past.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Lot of good batteries at a good price. Can you find CHEAPER batteries Yes but they're of worse quality. Can you find BETTER batteries Yes but it'll cost you. Both of those other options have their own usage scenarios, but these are a great middle ground that works in most average cases."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice having all these batteries at a good price. Haven't tried yet but, how bad can it be."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far so good as far as batteries go. I order them under subscribe and save. Makes the price even better and we always have plenty for our toddler.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They are batteries, what else can you say"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries...what can one say about them that wouldn't be too obvious LoL

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I love these batteries! I've got two 4 year olds that help me run through batteries as well as a flashlight I use constantly for work.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Love Amazon, but these batteries lasted 3 weeks in my Roku controller, Family Dollar store brand lasted longer. I do have A LOT of them though. Well played planned obsolescence :l"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As advertised!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Can't beat the price what so ever. Love AmazonBasics!!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Need a backup stock of AAA that you are willing to dispose of instead of keep track of and charge Amazon Basics does the job well and I have no complaints.I use these for my remote controls, gaming controllers (xb1, xb360, wiimotes), my receipting calculator, Logitech mice, etc! Pretty much whatever needs AAA batteries, this is my solution. :DCompared to the prices of of Energizer or Durcaell 12-packs, this beats those big time while meeting standards."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are awesome... we run 6-7 trail cameras on our ranch all year around to manage our ranch, and we are in constant need of changing batteries (and I mean constant). This package of batteries gives us the ability to order large quantities that we can store in one place, while it's also a CRAZY cheap price compared to all other battery brands. And they are great durable and long lasting batteries!! I'm forever hooked."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries are great quality.What I liked the best about it is the was its packaged! It comes in a card box that can be open/closed and in it the batteries are packaged with a wrapper in a group of 4.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Love this candle. When lights are turned out, it truly looks like a real candle. I bought 2 more and will probably get a few more for Christmas gifts."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I put these in a set of lights I have over my door and my Wii remote the day they arrived back in April and they are still going strong at the end of August! Love these!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Love this , got tired of buying the 2 name brands. My son goes through AA batteries like there is no tomorrow due to him using these for his xbox controller ( and yes, he has a rechargeable one also but.....it's always dead). For the money, I'll stick w/ the amazon brand batteries from now on"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love these batteries. I need to buy more. They hold their charge really well. I've replaced almost all my batteries with these batteries,"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great price, great battery life, great look, just great, love it :D"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I purchased these on 3/24/16 and last week I used a pair on a wireless keyboard. Within 1 hour my keyboard was blinking the low battery sign. I replaced the batteries with two new ones and the light blinked again within half an hour.My keyboard isn't the problem because I ended up using Eneloop AAA batteries and it worked fine the rest of the day.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,This was the 2nd time that I have ordered Amazon batteries only to find they all had about a half charge.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon batteries are awesome! Low cost and last long!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"While these batteries work, they don't last as long as expected. They lasted about 1/2 the time as a standard store bought battery (Energizer/Duracell/Rayovac). I will not buy these again. In contrast, the Amazon Basics AA Rechargeable is Awesome."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Used it for a mouse - works OK. I have a battery powered egg beater and when I put these batteries, the beater did not perform at full speed. I had some Duracell batteries which I used and it was back to life!!So, I guess these are low powered, Very disappointed"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great deal, work perfect."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"As good as any brand, but lower price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries perform just as well as the big name brands and for a fraction of the cost.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Do not last as long as Copper Top!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Picture for proof. I had these in an Amazon basics wireless mouse and one of them exploded. It was only in there about 3 months before I noticed the batteries were dead. Upon inspection it was clear one of the batteries had a structural failure and exploded the end apart leaking fluid inside mouse.This mouse has NEVER been out of my air conditioned office.I have never had a battery explode inside a mouse before. These are obviously low quality. Do not put them into anything you'd be upset to ruin with leaky battery fluid.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,more than half of these batteries didn't even last but three months while in storage. what a disappointment!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"lowest price per unit by far, great deal, that is what i was looking for. batteries work fine and last as long as any other"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I love Amazon and Amazon products but....MAJOR disappointment. While not much less cost that Duracell or Energizer the Amazon brand batteries were a ripoff! Only lasted a third of the time in the devices I have used the competitor's batteries in before.....bummer :(
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Make Amazon batteries YOUR BATTERIES ! If you haven't discovered this by now, that these alkaline batteries are fresher, longer lasting and more economical than wasting your money on dollar stores batteries or over-priced Duracell that may have been made years ago before you purchased them, get with it. Support a successful service that most of us can't do without !"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great pack of batteries. What can I say It's a great big box of AA batteries. Power is good!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works......not sure if better than other brands, have only used two so far for clocks.....go fish. Five star for price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Needed badly for so many appliances, work well and will hopefully last long!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Many batteries do not have full capacity. I read each with a meter before using. Often find one at .8 volt or below. I won't buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I'm not sure if it's coincidence it not but two electronics we've put these batteries in have crapped out within a day of replacing the batteries. When I pulled them out of the remote that completely spazzed out, there was moisture on the batteries. I thought that may have been my fault but then it happened again with a Christmas decoration. I'll probably return them...maybe a faulty batch"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Jury still out. Only recently used a couple.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I'm not sure these are lasting as long as more well-known brands. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Not sure.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good Deal!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Not worth buying, these are just a slight grade above cheap Chinese batteries. Your going to replace them x2 or x3 times as often as top of the line batteries. So take the price of top of the line batteries and divide it by 2 and then compare the price with these. Not bad for the price but not worth the hassle."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Can't beat the price for all these batteries. Why would people go to local store and pay exorbitant prices for batteries which you can get at a cheaper price. Maybe they last as long say for instance like Duracell or Eveready but for the price of an off brand, it is still well worth it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Meet expectations.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good, will keep buying Amazon Basics batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I'm sure they will meet my needs. Thanks.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Bummed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicker or something that isn't used often but we used these for Xbox one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Great price but they don't hold their charge for long. I find myself swapping out the remote batteries twice a year. At this price, it's not so bad but it's much more frequently that I'm used to."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These batteries work for normal things. But when i tried to use them for a dog collar that is supposed to help with barking, they were too weak and had to be changed after three uses. Annoying."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These die out super quickly. In saying that, I'm not sure if the items they were in sucked the life out of the faster but they still died. Used nearly a whole pack for little LED closet lights in a couple of months - only on for a few minutes at s time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These just don't last as long as the name brand product. Found that we replace these twice as often as a Duracell equivalent. Won't be buying them again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They don't last super long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"They are ok - I haven't had any arrive DOA, but they really don't seem to work for very long. In an Xbox One controller, they last about half the time that a set of duracells would. I don't think they're terrible, but I doubt I'll buy them again. You can frequently catch Duracells on Newegg at about 30 per 100. Yes, it's a bit more than the amazon basics per battery, but you'll get a lot more usage out of each pair."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,They don't last as long as other batteries. The Rayovacs that I get from Lowes are way better.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They work but clearly don't last as long as name brand batteries. If you want low cost batteries then buy these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great Product
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Met our need
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great bang for the buck. Amazon batteries....Who knew
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"A competing brand used to run my wireless trackball for two months, these last less than a week!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I purchased these batteries hoping they could hold their own amongst my other portable powered devices. Low and behold, I put these in a talking teddy bear and it proceeded to beat up the Energizer powered bunny in my house. I was very thankful for that because the darn rabbit's constant drum beating was driving me insane. After the bunny crawled away from the brawl bruised and defeated, the bear gave me a thumbs up and has protected me ever since. Thank you for these batteries Amazon, they have changed my life."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Only 32 batteries in the package when advertised as 36.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Some were nearly dead out of the box
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best looking batteries in the biz
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They work well I really did no comparison to other brands but the price was a great deal less .
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I'm a self proclaimed bargain shopper. But at the same time I want a quality product. I make a point of reading reviews to make sure that there are some satisfied customers before I take a chance on a product. I'm happy to say that these batteries were a good choice. I have grandkids that love to play video games using remotes that use 4 batteries per controller. They go through these things like crazy. So, finding some that were affordable was necessary to keep everyone happy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"What can I say, when I have nothing to say, but I have to in order to leave feedback"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I can never have enough batteries. We use them so quickly, I love to have extra boxes. These were a good price and they seem to work well."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"great price, great product, works well in all my devices and flashlights, see no difference in performance compared to the national brands"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal on these! Seem to have more initial power than most alkalines. Great for my electric razor! Get them if you have kids with lots of toys that eat batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works as well with the same time supply in very expensive name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Will never buy anything other than amazon brand!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. They all have problems working and the batteries have to be replaced after one use. Waste of time for what you get."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,More than 1/2 have been dead out of the box. Most other Amazon Basic products I have gotten have been great. Batteries have been beyond sub par so far.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Have used these for a few weeks and find they do not last quite as long as Duracell, but they are 1/3 the price. The price difference makes them a much, much better option. I will always reorder these in the future instead of the competition."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Worked well. I got these for some remote control mice I had purchased. Much fun was had scaring the office staff.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,so far they are good. just got them in today. so can't say how long thy will last. hopefully awhile.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"i use to buy my batteries from Cvs, rite aid these are great quality and long lasting."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Wow had these in my Xbox remote for 5 days non stop use and still a full charge !!!!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was previously buying batteries at dollar tree, 4 at time. This will not only save me time, but money and they're great quality for the price! As soon as I opened, I put them to use for my Xbox one wireless controller to try them out and they have lasted much longer than the batteries I was using before."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works great. You have to rinse it with hot water to remove all lint/ hair and let it dry. It's sticky again just like new ready to use again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"you have kids, teenagers that like toys, remote control cars or anything that require batteries then this is item is for you.. easy to use.. dont think about it just buy it.. : )"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,prefect and inexpensive
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Thanks, Amazon! I love the convenience of ordering batteries online and at a great rate. We put them into a battery organizer we have which is in our junk drawer (which is not junky thanks to the organizer). The batteries work well as far as we can tell, and it's great to get them at a low cost with free shipping."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cant beat these batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Yes it met all expectations for speed, durability. My grandson Loved it"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"It seems every toy my 2 year old currently owns has batteries in it for the price, I can't find a better deal on a battery than these.I don't know about all that fancy ratings that other reviewers write about, but I know when I put these in a toy for my son, he starts smiling again. That's all I need from a product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"My life changed when I bought these. I didn't know what to expect, but the best way I can describe them is bottled lightning. It's amazing -- these things deliver electricity to my headphones, remotes, flashlights, wireless mouse, and more. These will work in just about anything that fits these small cylinders. It's like magic.One problem I found is that you need to put them in the right way. Might take a few times to get it right, but once you do, you'll be happy. Also, does not fit in AAA sockets. If Amazon could fix that, it would be EPIC!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I'm the kind of person that always stocks batteries. With a small child that has lots of toys (not to mention my own toys) you never know what size batteries you'll need. C is a size only a few of my devices use. One is a lantern and the other is an electronic pest deterrent that I have to keep the deer away from my growing trees. I have always purchased the big two name brands in batteries and I always make sure to buy Alkaline batteries. My love for Amazon and their AmazonBasics products brought me to these and with the Amazon pricing and quality, I figured I couldn't go wrong.These batteries come in easy to open packaging and have the same shelf life as competing brands. I bet that one of those two brands makes these batteries for Amazon and simply private labels their name on them, as the quality is obviously there. I see no difference in longevity, shelf life, size or quality. If you're looking to save a few bucks but still have a top performing battery, look no further than AmazonBascis alkaline batteries. I hope you found my review helpful!My reviews are my opinions of the product received and just my opinion. Everyone is different and could have a different opinion of a product. I do not receive any monetary payment for my reviews, and I always keep them honest. So no need to worry whether or not my review is genuine, because it is. Also if you found this review helpful marking it as so would be greatly appreciated thanks!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, so good. My new source for batteries. I love me some Amazon"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Last longer than Energizer. They're no Duracell, but hey, you can't beat them all, all the time! Am I right I'll pretty much be investing in these batteries for the rest of my life."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are now my go-to batteries....sorry copper top. I used them for lights at my daughter's wedding and they are still going strong!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"my parents need it. Honestly, I am looking to buy a few, cheap. Good bargain for the money. Very comfortable and very fine . They are not for me, they do not ride, they are not too tight Very fast, receive it next day."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best way to have electronics work is having them be charged or have batteries! Buying this pack will fix the needing batteries part!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,My son goes through batteries like crazy so I bought him this pack for his birthday no complaints and they last a lot longer than dollar store batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These batteries seem to have enough power. My sons remote monster truck barely moves with new batteries installed from her byut work perfectly fine with new Duracells. However, for basic other stuff they do the job."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are every bit as good as the name brands, at a very nice price. Will order again for sure."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are as good as any national brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I have been using Amazon Basics Batteries for some time now. They are just as good as the name brands that cost a good bit more. We don't use as many disposable batteries as we used to but even after being stored for some time the quality does not seem to degrade. There is no reason to waste money purchasing the brand names when the Amazon Basics are of the same quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,stock up on these at a great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I need batteries that register 1.5V out of the box my camera flash remotes depend on it! NONE of the batteries I tested were more than 1.3V fresh out of the box. Unacceptable! Spend a few more bucks and get some decent name brand batteries. These are pathetic. Anyone need a 20-pack of 1.3V batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These we got for the flashlight for a birthday party. They work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I have no qualms about the quality of these batteries.I only wish that every 4 batteries were not individually wrapped.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Shortest battery life ever... definitely don't try to save a few bucks here ...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Terrible! Didn't last 2 weeks!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BATTERIES IVE EVER USED AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL THEM
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for the price! I NEVER buy batteries from the store now!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,stock up
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good to have A batteries at such a good price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We tend to forget to buy batteries until hurricane season rolls around, so what a lifesaver this package is. We've purchased several different sizes, all good. They appear to last as long as other brands. Will definitely order more."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This box of batteries was a great value. Better than buying from the other box stores. I like how they came in an easy to open cardboard box. Each set of 4 inside the box is wrapped in a thin layer of plastic so the batteries don't roll around and make a mess. I used these to replenish all my kids' talking/lightup toys...as those toys don't generally work well with rechargables. I'm going to buy more of these as needed!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"New source for batteries. I'll keep a box or two of these around the house from now on.Less packaging would be nice. A sealed box, then shrinkwrap."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,The package just arrived and all seems well. I have no information on the life of these batteries. If they do well I would be glad to give them 5 stars.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for a great price

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I did not know that amazon sold batteries.nice stuff
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I usually buy Duracell but decided to try these Amazon batteries. They're good. Not sure I'd remember to buy them again but they worked well for me.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,it's great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Long lasting
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Needed some decent batteries. Gets the job done.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are good batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are nice for the money and they last as long as the big name brands. Thanks Amazon
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I like that they come in a very nice compact package though I could do without the plastic wrap of four each. So far they work just as well as the ones I used to buy from Costco but I don't have to wait for Costco's sale and deal with Costco's packaging.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice amount of batteries to have on hand, have not used any yet so waiting to see how these will perform!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"My wee computer mouse sure eats batteries, thankfully these were available. I like having extras around for my wee LED flashlights also."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price and arrived quick!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These don't last quite as long as Duracell, but for the price it's hard to complain. Nice basic batteries. No issues except for slightly shorter lifespan."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice Batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These works great for everyday use
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is the first time I buy amazon batteries. Was a little skeptical at first, but this batteries work as good as the major brands. Very happy with the purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They power things. They work. Also a good price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries! Do their job.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I like the battery pack, I haven't had time to try them yet."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice box, good price. Only improvement would be to eliminate the 4pack wrapping. The clear plastic wrap seems like an unnecessary step when changing our kids toy batteries"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Lasting a long time in my remotes. Nice easy to open packaging.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,would buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Packaged nicely.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Speedy delivery, convenient packaging - and the batteries seemed to last longer than usual in my application (wireless mikes) - still had 3 bars at the end of a 3-hour run, where most commonly I'd be down to 1 or 2 bars. Would buy again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Fantastic prices these Amazon batteries are. Haven't used very long so I can't say how they perform yet.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Just received them and trying them out. So far so good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They fit where they're supposed to and have good durability.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice product. As described.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice set of batteries at a good price point. Don't last as long as the name brand ones but for the price it's worth it to buy these. I only have amazon batteries in my house
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Nice to have a easy to access package that doesn't allow the batteries to just keep falling out once opened like most battery packages.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I like that I can order these on-line with Prime shipping directly to my house in a few days. I use a lot of batteries during the holidays starting with Halloween through Easter. Not a bad price and they seem to last awhile.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Only confusion was the difference between our current dip switch and this one. If it does not work flip the switches in the opposite directions.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Work great and is a rather convenient way to purchase batteries. Though, they package 4 per cellophane wrapping and it is kind of annoying to get off, but that's just me being nit-picky"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"nice , just found my new batteries , great price , expires 2026"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great product!!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal great product!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Standard product good battery life!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They do the job. Nicely packaged too!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Some of the best batteries I've ever bought. Last a long time, and VERY nicely packages. Batteries are individually packaged into packs of 4 so that is very nice."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good, batteries work as they should."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Batteries do not last! Don't waste your money on these. I've been using them in a weight scale where 4 batteries would last 4-6 months. With these batteries, I only get 10 days of usage. No battery life."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Only way I'll ever buy batteries again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Dead on arrival...please stay away.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,for the price they work fine.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have tried numerous brands of disposable batteries: big (costly) name brands, cheaper name brands,brands made companies that make electronics,ect.I would say these are better than the cheaper name brands ... But, not as good as the high dollar name brands. They fall in the middle, and for the price you really can't complain!!They are individually wrapped in packs of 4 , which is nice. We have used in Xbox remotes (last about 4/5 weeks with moderate use) Children's toys (seem to drain quicker in the toys) And portable CD players (average drain)Overall, I am happy with them and would definitely buy again!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"they're batteries, they're cheap, and they work just fine"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries work great! No issue with battery life. I order this pack every few months to keep up with our computer mouse, video game controllers, and misc battery needs. Can't beat the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No complaints here! Very satisfied with these batteries. So far I've used them primarily in LED candles and they've worked great basically on continuously. I think they are comparable to the Kirkland brand that I normally use. I will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,no complaints!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,No complaints.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good. I'll buy all my batteries from Amazon basics in the future.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works as good as the higher-priced, name-brand batteries. No complaints."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazonbasics products so far haven't failed me now, no defectsGreat buy for batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works great. Just as good as name brand . Will get again
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have been using these Amazon batteries in my remote controls in the living room and they seem to last a pretty good while. Cheaper than alot of the other high dollar brands with the same, if not better, result. Would buy again..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Work great! No leakage or discharge (so far) like we've had from some other store brand batteries. Not quite sure how long they hold up, but they seem to be doing as well as the name brand batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are certainly A+. They arrived quickly and are packaged in a box that you can easily open and close, so you don't have to have some fancy space contraption to contain them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"In a box of 12 batteries, 4 worked for 2 months, 8 did not work at all, Total waste of money"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,It only took my little demons 3 days to figure out how to jimmie this thing open. It was really great while it lasted though.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery. I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leaks. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaked while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitored One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packaging, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tab to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Batteries popped open inside the motion detector lights making a mess and ruining the detector. I will never buy this brand again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Do not buy. Inconsistent quality, performance, some leak and ruin things."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They work great and a price nicely
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Batteries work great. As expected. No issues with delivery or life span on batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries worked just fine and unlike the last Energizer batteries, they didn't leak. I'll never buy Energizer again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good Deal for the price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very pleased with these batteries. If you have children you know keeping a supply of batteries for all their toys is essential. These are about the same price as batteries in the dollar store but the quality of the big names. Will be buying more for years to come.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No need to spend money on large name brand batteries these work the same and i feel that last just as long and if they do not you get 3/4 the life span of a more expensive battery at a fraction of a price. Don't think just buy them
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,we will never buy any more!!!! they suck!!!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Batteries died after a week. Same appliance used Duracell batteries for half a year.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Good price.... but (update 12/21/2016)Update - horrible batteries. Have gone through 8 out of 48 batteries and none have worked. Contacted Amazon, they state they will refund my money and apologized. Great customer service,but horrible product.Be aware of the refund/return policy with Amazon. Batteries are something I don't test when i get them, I assume they will work when I need them. Have never had a problem before now. When to put 2 AA's in an LED flashlight..... nothing. Tried 2 more.... nothing. Tried 2 more....nothing 2 more (guess what)... nothing again. Tried it my TV remote too. Same results. Not something I would trust to stock up with for a power outage.While the product gets 1 star (that's too generous) I do give Amazon and their Customer Service 5 Stars."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I am giving these batteries a 1 star because I couldn't go any lower. I tried 10 batteries in a row and they lasted bout 35 seconds then my light went out. The shelf life must have been ending. I guess the old addage You Get What You Paid For holds true.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I like amazon products. But these haven't worked in any thing I've put them in. Nerf gun, toys.. nothing. Maybe they work in remotes....."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"No problems here! Using these for a variety of things, mostly just remotes and Xbox controllers though they have also been used in an external DSLR flash with no problems."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is a lot of battery for really good price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"It's true that these do not last as long as the big brands, especially in electronics (I opt for higher end batteries for things like my Mac mouse). BUT, the big brands are being knocked off all of the time. Even on this site, even with batteries purchased directly from Amazon, reviewers have found knockoffs.And knockoffs are not only a waste of money because they do not match the quality of the real brand, they can be dangerous. It is not unusual for knockoffs to lead acid into your equipment or device, and even to explode!So, I know that with AmazonBasics, I'm getting a safe and reputable brand.Perhaps if I were buying from a national bricks and mortar store, I would choose Duracell or Energizer. But on the web, AmazonBasics is the safe way to go."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"received the wrapping paper thank you.but no batteries ever came,nor were they in the package with my wrapping paper"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Im sure these are fine batteries, but they never arrived, and theres no way for me to request a replacement."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"these apparently have been sitting around for some time, I used 2 in a TV remote and they were almost dead within just a few days. I exchanged the two for two more from the same pack, and again about 3-4 days later they were dead. hereafter I'll buy a name brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries don't have the power equal to Energizer or Duracell brands. If you get lucky and they power your device, they don't last very long. We still 3 unoped packs of 4 batteries each, but whenever we try them in most products, they do NOT work."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Best battery buy in town. So far, no duds. I have been buying for the last 3 years and worth the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"unless they leak, this is a wonderful product"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Basic performance didnt last a week in an AM radio.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Do not last as long as other cut price batteries. In my Canon digital camera I cannot get off more than 3 shots before the 'low-battery' warning comes on. I am going back to Maxell, which did much better for me.I would hate to see what the capacity of the AmazonBasics EveryDay batteries are!!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE, BUT YOU CAN BEAT ME. WORKS WELL, ESPECIALLY WHEN GROUPED TOGETHER AND PUT IN A SOCK."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"poor performer, does not last long at all."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I bought these because of all the ratings on Amazon but they don't last at all!! I am so disappointed. I used the in every device and every solar light and withing 2 months I have to replace them all. Now, with the the snow and cold, my yard is dark because I can't get out there. I will never buy these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These are OK but they don't hold up or last very long. We bought these during Christmas hoping they would be great esp since alkaline but they barely hold up to the wear and tear of everyday use in a TV remote, let alone a kids toy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"There ok, not as good as I would of liked for what I need them for. I would purchase again.Fast , good delivery."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Not as good as name brand but worth the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I bought 20 and I used 9 in three Motorola Walkabouts radios.One the second use, after only two hours use on first, a battery failed. I was shocked at this. It made my Walkabout useless for the child-safety reason I bought it.Noqw I cannot trust the rest and I will use then in unimportant places like toys."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Don't last quite as long as name brand, but worth the money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,not bad
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These are a good price. I don't feel they last very long. Perhaps they would be great in a remote or something that draws very little. I have them in my outdoor battery operated Christmas lights and I have had to replace them already (only 2 weeks of use). The name brand ones last all season.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They don't last as long as the major brands, but for the price you can't beat it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Doesn't last as advertised. Dead in no time!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These batteries drain quickly. While you get a lot of them, the quality just isn't there. If you need reliable batteries, look elsewhere."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These are cheap and they Explode!!!!!! I was pumping at 2am and it exploxed in my pump. It leaked all over my pump and baby blankets!!!!! Ive never had this happen with name brand!!!!! Now I have to find time with a newborn to packed up all the batteries from all our baby items and return!! Not Cool!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They work and have a great price point.I haven't tested their capacity myself, but did spend a bit of time looking for reviews and stuff. These seem to be about on par with the Costco duracells. That's plenty fine for me and I really like the price and convenience.When you get right down to it, all I really care about with AA batteries is that I don't buy crap. These aren't crap."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They don't last as long as a Duracell but they are cheaper.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,not even sure if the price and quantity you get are just as comparable than other leading brands. these seem not to hold a long lasting charge
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Despite what seems to be a great deal for a 48pack of AA batteries these aren't great. 2 stars only because of the deal as they're for light use. I use them only for my xbox controllers, I understand that the life is different with gaming (sucking up all the energy), but I've put a pair in before and about 2 weeks later had to change them. Not to mention, I have 2 controllers (one has a grip), so I switch between them often. This means they should last longer since I'm not just draining the battery life on one of them. Overall, not great for gaming or heavy use, otherwise they're nice backups. I'll have to compare these to say Duracell, but from past experience I don't remember having to change them so often."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great battery, great price. NOT frustration-free though. Each row of 4 batteries was wrapped up so you had to open 12 packs individually."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,i have bought the AA 48 packs twice now and they are terrible... They don't even last a month...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I ordered these batteries 2 months ago. I don't really have a lot of things that require AAA batteries. My tv remote finally died and I put in these batteries. And my remote tells me that these brand new batteries are low.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Ordered the Triple AAA battery pack and I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or what but pretty much not a single battery works. What a waste of money so they definitely deserve one star.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"They do not last long. I literally added these to a flashlight that's typically never used. I used these batteries in that particular flashlight about 3 times for a total of maybe 3-4 minutes. I switched it on today, and the batteries are already almost depleted. I wouldn't purchase them again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Been going through a pair a week in my Xbox One controller. I play about 4 hrs a day average so the performance is underwhelming.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I used these in a mini led flashlight, which I use to walk my dog every night. I use the flashlight about 20-30 minutes every night and the batteries only last maybe 3 weeks."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,They do not last as long and I had hoped. Meaning they run down really fast. Would not buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I'm a huge Amazon fan and I know the appeal here for most and me as well is the price but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for and these do not last anything near the better more expensive batteries out that. If it's easy to change batteries then this is the way to go but if you have something it's difficult or a pain or you just don't want to the hassle I would suggest spending more and getting the upper brands, and by that I mean the more expensive, most expensive of the batteries out there, they really do last longer. It's a shame because you know they have the ability to make batteries last longer, all companies, and yet they don't just so we'll come back and buy more"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Great price but didn't last long at all.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Ok for general use, but does not last long."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These are not comparable to Duracell. I have been running around changing batteries everywhere, remotes, clocks, battery-powered soap dispensers. All the dying batteries are the lame Amazon basics. Bought duracells at Costco. They probably last twice as long. I bought these to get free shipping on orders over 35. Don't do the same. It's not worth it. Very disappointing."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Triple A batteries , not much to say other than I was happy with the convenience that Amazon offers. No issues and am happy with my purchase"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I have a simple electronic keypad I use these batteries in. With the name brand I would go about 2 months. With the amazon brand i go 2 weeks. Not sure I am sold on this being an equivalent battery just yet.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,My 8 pack batteries were NOT charged so if you are buying these for a trip or something be warned.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Arrived as advertised and ahead of schedule. Not quite as long lasting as a major name brand but good for the price point.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Gave these a fair chance but the fact is they simply do not last as long as Duracells. I've gone through more than half of the pack I purchased and I am easily replacing batteries twice as fast for the same devices, same use. I won't repurchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Some work, some don't. Some will power my TV remote but the same batteries wouldn't power a different type of remote. I won't buy these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These are odd. Several times so far I have put them into some device and the circuit does not work so it seems dead. Tested the batteries with a tester and they read 1.6 volts, so they are fully charged. Put in energizers, duracells, that show 1.58 volts and the device works perfectly. Tried one of each brand and got mixed results. Good price but Ray o Vacs are about the same and no problem. I don't know what is wrong but for now, I don't like them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"A great price, to be sure...but EVERY flameless candle I have put these into has been very dim. When I replaced with Duracell (and local grocery store brand as well) the candles are noticeably brighter. Don't think I'll be buying AmazonBasics batteries again soon -- which is a bummer. I have always been impressed with Amazon-brand products but these batteries are all that."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,not so wonderful - I don't think these batteries last any longer than the ones I buy at the dollar stores.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Not suitable for toys. Drained within just a couple of days.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Not sure about these yet. The question is whether the battery last long enough for the price that i paid for them. Will update later when i find out.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Not sure I will be buying these again. The first four pack I opened was dead. The second pack worked but only lasted half the time a name brand battery lasts. I am using more batteries for the same amount of use in my headset. I won't be buying these again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Not a bad price but after few times I realize these battery run out very fast. Amazon need to do better with that.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Some loss power fast, in a TV remote."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Marginal performance at best. Used one in my Turbo razor, and it died much earlier than other brands. It also dies quickly, with a steep power drop-off."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I'm not too thrilled with the life of these batteries. They don't seem to last as long as energizer does. And in some things, they aren't even strong enough to get rid of the 'dead battery' reading."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I have bought these several times thinking they were great but after longer term use have found they fail about twice as fast as Duracell. I will never buy them again and will not hold Amazon Basic in such A high standard. my next batteries will be Duracell
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"What's happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I thought that this was a great deal, but the batteries don't seem to last very long. I feel like I am constantly having to change the batteries in my remote. I would equate these to being a little bit better than dollar store batteries, but they are not of the highest quality."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I used these in my Xbox controller. Hardly ever lasted more than 2-3 weeks if I play regularly on weekends and a couple weekdays.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Don't seem to last as long as Duracell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Worst batteries I have ever purchased. I use in the mouse to my laptop. Doesn't hold a charge for more than three days with limited usage (maybe 4 hours/day). Not worth the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"On second use, silver liquid leaked out of batteries, almost ruining the motor of a breast pump."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They seem to last just as long as the namebrand batteries. Since I have a grandchild that's got LOTS of battery powered toys, the more I can save on batteries, the happier I am."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Exceptional value. Shipped quickly. Well packaged. Nothing bad to say
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Every time I brew a cup off coffee there are tons of coffee grinds in my coffee. I have cleaned my pot several times. Thank god I only have a few pods left. Will never buy this brand again!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Everybody's already talked about how great and dependable these batteries are - I bought these based on those reviews. Now I just wish AmazonBasics would put out coin batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Overpriced, works about the same as raovac."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,nothing special - seem to work just fine but won't know how they stand up to name-brand batteries for quite a while
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just batteries. Nothing special or bad about them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Nothing much unusual or extraordinary to say here: they're batteries, and they work fine. Probably only really worth it if you either are patient about shipping, or have Prime. Otherwise, you're not missing much by getting some batteries from the grocery store or somewhere vs. these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Wow ! Let there be light !
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,If I ever need AA batteries too bad what I actually meant to get was AAA ... my fault.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Decent quality. Of course Great seller )
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Of the four used so far, two already lost charge, one so much as giving a negative read on a voltmeter."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're the only batteries I use now. It's hard to beat the /battery cost. Every parent should have a stash of these and the Amazon AA's in their home.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,We are very disappointed in the quality of Amazon's AA batteries. They have failed 3 or 4 times in various products we own. The most costlywas it's use in our small wall safe in our home. The 6 batteries failed after two months and we had to have a service open it at the tune of225.00. Another example was a radio and flashlights. We will have to throw the rest out.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Long lasting cheap batteries what more do you ent
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Basic battery
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good deal
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,How do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I feel like they don't work as long.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Love the price but for me,they just don't seem to last as long as my other brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,ok
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These seem to last almost as long as the pro cell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works ok
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Price is good but I don't think these batteries perform as well as their peers. Reading reviews from actual electricians, I think they agree.I love Amazon products but wouldn't buy these again (unless they were more than half off their competitor's prices)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I have a digital charger that has been very effective at recharging alkaline batteries. I usually get two or three 90 charges from a quality battery before it starts to leak. These are fine for their original life, but none could handle a recharge. Yes, I know that's what all alkaline batteries advertise, but at this price, which is equivalent to what I pay for Maxell and others, I expected a more robust container."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a tv remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are OK."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"OK, good price but don't expect Duracell longevity."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I buy a lot of these. I don't think that the longevity is exceptional but they are inexpensive in bulk. Worry about recycle maybe need to consider rechargeables
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Don't seem to last very long changing brands
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,the charge holds a bit
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They work
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,It seems the plus pole pins of these batteries are somewhat shorter than the poles of other brand batteries. The batteries didn't make contact in some of the devices I was planning to use them in.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,THEY ARE OK.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good product
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"they seem to work well, not super impressed but sufficient."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They seem to die pretty fast.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Serves the purpose. Good for the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Okay if you're using for household use, I tried to use with my speedlites for photography and these ran out entirely too quickly."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,they ok same as others
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"On average, these batteries do not last as long as the Energizer. They cost less to buy, but overall, there isn't much saving."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"No issues, unless I put them in backwards. Same quality but cheaper than the name brands"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Was very disappointed to see that one of my batteries corroded and leaked in a device within only a few days of placing it in the device. Will not purchase again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"What can I say... I need them, they work, and they're less expensive."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Going to keep my review short and brief, since the chances are that it will not be seen due to so many reviews already posted.If you're talking about rechargeable batteries, everyone knows that the Panasonic Eneloops are one of the best because they are the most reliable for discharging (usage, basically) and that they hold a lot of charge. While the non-rechargeable batteries do not measure in mAh, these Amazon Basic ones are very much comparable in every way. I found this to be extremely interesting since I have yet to see non-rechargeable batteries perform so well. Then I researched into this and found that they are made in Japan - the same place that the original Eneloop and Fujitsu batteries are made which are where the top notch AA or AAA batteries ever made."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Bought these because I had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generics and get comparable quality to name brands. It is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage. These, after a year, would begin leaking soon after installing them. That is, they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days. They fouled up a few things, one of which was a good work flashlight. I hadn't seen a battery leak in decades. I had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,5 of the batteries leaked from the package. Will not buy these again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,About 1/3 the life of energized or Duracell batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,All were dead
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,amazon sucks these batteries drain like the water in my toilet
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"As soon as i place the new battery in my card alarm, ut says 1 bar charged"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Substandard...Dollar store batteries last longer
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,terrible
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,The capacity is suspect. I seem to have gotten a lot more out of Energizer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,The products that it was delivered but I could not find it anywhere
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These are absolute junk. I'm half way through the pack and so far every single battery has leaked.UPDATE:Ok, these batteries are horrible. Every single battery leaked, ruining some of the items they were in. In almost 30 years of buying from Amazon these batteries are the most disappointing thing thing I've ever received.Amazon, in case you are interested the lot number is JK150601"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Worst batteries ever....they work once and drain out...you try to use something again and the battery is dead!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Worst batteries I've ever bought.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Worst battery I've ever used. Lasts 1/3 as long as eveready!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Wrong Item
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I only buy batteries from Amazon. Love the Duracell Procell deals but the Amazon branded batteries seem just as good. No way can I score these deals locally.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Not much to say about batteries but I really love the Amazon Basics products. Great price and same performance as Duracell or similar popular brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon never ceases to amaze me...maybe thats why i ONLY shop on here! Thee batteries have great life and price. Bye bye duracell or energizer!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I bought these batteries to put into my bluetooth wireless speaker so that I didn't have to always have it plugged into it's AC power source. After only an hour of using my speaker with these batteries, my speaker died! I'm sad and disappointed that the batteries only managed to give me an hour of listening through my speaker, and honestly I'm shocked too. I read a lot of great reviews for these batteries and unfortunately, for me it did not deliver the quality that I wanted and needed :(."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What can I say here. These batteries are fantastic. I'll never pay for brand name batteries again. This is the only way to go!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I have used AmazonBasics batteries in the past and they are the only ones I order now. For the price per battery you wont get a longer lasting battery!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,THESE BATTERIES ARE VERY GOOD PRICE LAST VERY GOOD WHILE. USE THESE ALL THE TIME
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are great. We get them using the subscribe and save to get an additional 15 off!! You can't beat that price for a good battery
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,ordered the batteries with the LED lytes
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Ordered these for items i received from Amazon and they were packagedwell and preformed perfectly. Will definitely order moreAmazonBasics batteries. Da HYP
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Best price for a none name brand battery, however, they last just as long as name brands for a pack of batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Much better quality than the Eveready batteries I normally purchase at a discount store. My telephone headset eats through batteries which is why I don't like to spend too much on them - the first time I used these batteries they outlasted them!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Whoever makes these, Great job they last and last and do not leak. We have been buying them for a year now and not a bad one in the bunch."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries for an outstanding price! Order here, not through your local store - you'll regret it! It's nothing better than having a drawer full of batteries, too, for those last-minute needs!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Outstanding product....well made....high quality...no complaints here
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"At .28 cents a battery...and free two day shipping if you are a Prime member this AA Battery deal is a no brainer! There is nothing else in a retail store near me that can match this deal.The batteries are first rate alkaline, and so far have been working great in all the gadgets I have put them in. I have started buying all my batteries from Amazon. The prices and quality just can't be beat."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Outstanding value. They came fast too! Will purchase again. No need to go into Costco and wait in the long lines just for batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Haven't used them, they look fine. Probably overpaid. They arrive in a fancy cardboard box, like they're collectibles or something."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries made it here safe and undamaged.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Packaging of the product is perfect. Often when buying batteries in bulk they are not separated. These came in a small box with perfectly wrapped batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,packed in 4.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,NOT MUCH POWER IN THESE BATTS
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I waited to write this review until I had tried nearly all of the batteries that I ordered. Most of them did not have any power in them. The few that did work lasted maybe an hour. I pitched the remaining 6 because I cannot depend on them at this point. Maybe I just got a bad batch but these are the worst collection batteries I have ever used. I would not recommend these to anyone else based on my experience.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate. It was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket. Then a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufators use the same controler design) and i hsve no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. We lost the reciever after a few weeks. It might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Having had a problem with Duracell batteries, (most of them destroyed electronic items of mine, even leaking in the original wrapper) I noticed that the cheap Chinese batteries that come with items have given me no problem. I decided why should I pay the price for a name brand and have practically every one start leaking (all before the use by date). So far these batteries have been just fine. I'll continue to use them and check the condition a little more often."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,You get what you pay for. These batteries are cheap and don't last as long as Duracels or Energizer. If I had to estimate I'd say they last around 50 as long as those mentioned.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Now I know why these are so inexpensive! I'm baffled as to how they've earned such high reviews. I've used them in a variety of devices portable LED lights that I utilize maybe once every two months for events, in a battery-operated soap-dispenser, in tap lights in a closet/hallway, in toys... In the soap-dispenser, they lasted three weeks. I thought the dispenser must be faulty, switched them out. Next set of these batteries lasted a week. In the LED lights, the batteries lasted five hours. Less in the toys and tap lights. At this rate, I'll have used the whole box of 20 batteries in less than 6 months. What a wasteful, useless product!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Not sure why I purchased so many batteries, but it is a wonderful feeling knowing that I have so many if needed."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect packaging. Great price. Perf.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys. I have found them less than adaquate for the items they were used in. In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controllers like TV remotes, they last less than a month. They may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Came in handy for the holidays. All toys sent n with batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great to have a load of extra batteries when you have children who use battery operated toys.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Inexpensive and works great!! We plow through batteries with three kids and every damn toy that is battery driven.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Item as described. Fast delivery. Perfect.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nice to have spare batteries when needed. At the price it is a great value, but they do not last as long as the Duracell but then those are 3x as much money. So for the price I feel this is an excellent deal. Very happy with these batteries.Highly Recommend!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good. And a very attractive price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,what a deal
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,work perfectly
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect all those little things! If you are using high-drain devices please buy AmazonBasics pre-charged NiMh rechargeable batteries and a charger such as the 16-bay titanium charger!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very nice item item as described delivered on time very prompt will shop again
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Who doesn't need a pack of batteries Economical and last a long time. I keep mine in the freezer and have never had a problem with them not being fully charged.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Absolutely perfect case for a near-perfect phone. This case fits perfectly.After a few days of use you'll forget you have a case on the phone.The phone's smooth rounded edges make it near impossible not to drop the phone occasionally. This case is a must for the LG v20.The quality of this case is the best I have ever seen in a smartphone case.Well done!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work great! Very, Very Long lasting. Arrived early."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Perfect for our emergency survival basement pantry. I haven't opened the box, and just sealed them in plastic."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Works like a charm.Some batteries were already dead/not charged at the factory.When they are being used they carry a acceptable long charge
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work well in my Xbox controllers.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect for keeping my wireless mouse and other electronics around the house working. It's always good to buy in bulk since they tend to go fast seeing as how I have a lot of electronics.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I order these A LOT! works perfect for my son's toys and last as long as the major brands an so much cheaper. Also the packaging makes storage easy as well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect for my needs.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Excellent value. These come packaged in little sleeves of four in a large cardboard box. Amazon Basics batteries have always been good performers. We've been using them for a couple of years and haven't had any issues with them drying up quickly or being lackluster upon first use. Nice quality, great deal."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Always great to get AA batteries in bulk. Everything uses these things, we have like 20 remotes that are constantly chewing up batteries as well as flashlights and small candles. These work great and came at a great price. What more could you ask for"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"With alot of kids and toys in the house we have been running through hundreds of batteries. Yes hundreds, no typo. I have found these batteries to have the perfect balance of cost vs longevity. They dont last the longest but theyre priced just right to make it worth it. I would recommend to anyone that needs batteries in bulk."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"We got these for our TV remote. We didn't need such a large package, but it was the cheapest option, so we went ahead and purchased the 20 pack. It was great to be able to save money over the name brands, and since it was Amazon brand, we figured they would be good quality (and we were right). It was also awesome to be able to get them in 2 days, since our TV buttons are very hard to use so the shorter time without a remote, the better!Work great. Probably won't run out of AAA anytime soon, but would consider buying other sizes when needed."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As far as performance goes they seem to be holding up well. They deliver the correct amount of power and work just fine in all the devices that require this size. Cannot beat the price on these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works well without spending an arm and a leg for the same thing!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can trust Amazon to bring you great products at great price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Only battery's we buy anymore

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best deal for batteries out there. They last forever in kid's toys!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries at a great price. No complaints at all.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great price! These batteries work great. They're delivered in a nice sturdy box and packaged in groups of four, which is very convenient. Can't beat the price either."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Lots for very little. These are great batteries to have on hand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,perfect!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are great and long lasting. I refilled every little flashlight and wish I had more to spare.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries at a great price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Wow! What a great price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Loving this amazon basics line! Great prices and I believe the Amazon brand works just as well as any. I bought these huge cases of batteries because I'm moving soon and I wanted to stock up. You get A LOT for your money! I like how these are wrapped because I specifically need them to store for emergencies, and I don't have to worry about them leaking.Just get the Amazon brand!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Hard to beat for the price. Shipped fast and fresh.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They all come in a box wrapped 4 in a bunch. You always have newly packaged batteries and not a mess rolling around, like the ones energizer sells that are all put together. Don't last as long as Energizer but still pretty long!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perform as predicted
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent batteries! Even better than some name-brand overpriced ones we've bought
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Batteries just don't have the strength or long run time. Read all the possitive and negative comments before I bought and they are true.These batteries are good to poor in performance. They start good and quickly drain down to poor. Under heavy load they drain very quickly, will come back with a rest but drain faster each time. Dont use in equipment that have a heavy demand. Clocks would be ok. Expect 1/2 the performance of the leading brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have been pleasantly surprised by the performance of all of the AmazonBasics products that I've purchased, and this is no exception.Battery life on par with traditional Energizer alkaline batteries, for a fraction of the price. Yes, please!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Cant beat it.. performs just as good if not better than the big brands, at more than half the cost.. Life span is awesome thus far.. ill never buy from the big guys again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are fantastic! They perform just as well as any other name brand battery but they cost significantly less. I never have any worries with any Amazon branded item and these do not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks and get these batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great quality for the price. Will buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Pleasantly surprised with these batteries. Powered my son's toy tablet quite well along with other remote control cars that they use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Buy these. They do not last at all.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Pleased with the performance of these batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great battery. They last as long as any other, I see. Great price, too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazing quantity of durable batteries at excellent price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Great price, however battery life is not comparable to other brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"After receiving this box of batteries, as we made our way through them, we realized that the batteries were all close to dead. Now we are past the return date. Not buying these again. Would give zero star rating if I could."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy. Nope. I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about 13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I compared these against the Costco Kirkland brand and was quite disappointed with the Amazon Basic AA batteries. I used these in a flashlight test and after two hours, the Costco brand still worked fine, but the Amazon Basics were close to dead. I'm very disappointed with this brand and won't buy it again. For short term use, it's fine, but they don't last over time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Terrible life. These are poorest quality batteries I have ever purchased both AA and AAA
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Batteries leaked when in charging station.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Don't think they were as good as the ones I get at Dollar Tree. I will not buy again they were a waste of money
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries are very poor quality and do not last even half the time of standard Energizer or Duracell batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Horrible quality. These last 4 to 6 days in an Xbox controller and maybe 10 days in a remote. Horrible quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,these are junk. you get a large quantity but they are not long-lasting and sometimes need to be changed after only a few hours of continuous use.i do not recommend these and will not purchase them again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Bought these and regret it. I must have gotten a bad batch since these were lasting only three weeks in my smoke detectors. After a few weeks, all smoke detectors using them started beeping like they are low on power. A battery tester confirmed the batteries were low. I replaced them with store-bought Rayovac batteries and haven't had any issues."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Your milage may vary. My milage is after being recharged less than ten times, two different sets of the batteries rapidly lost capacity to hold charge (from full to empty in 30 seconds) and leaked, each time in a different devices, damaging at least one of them.. I'm hesitant to try any more of them.My opinion garbage.I have been using rechargeable batteries for years. Frys' no name, Energizer and Duracell all worked great. The AmazonBasics are no where near the level of the these brands in regards to quality."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Multiple batteries leaked, ruining one toy and causing messes in other items. Poor quality."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries working great so far. I threw the box in my freezer and take out what i need when i need them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No complaints
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"THE POWER! Yup, they work. No defective ones. They last as long as name brand AA batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work and were very affordable.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price lasts a long time. I stock up. Kids toys all seem to need batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Uhhhhh, loads of batteries at a good price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal and price....
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far these have worked great and fit the need well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cost effective power.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal on AAA batteries. I recommend.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect price and convenience. I needed some for walkie-talkies I got for my grandkid's and this will last them a little while.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Tested at a higher voltage than other new AAA batteries and well worth the price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work as I expected.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Long lasting batteries at a great price. I would purchase them again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,How can you go wrong with batteries from Amazon You can't!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Are a gift , haven't given yet"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Enough batteries to last quite a long time at a discounted price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won't last mare than a week in my TV remote. Pretty annoying!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I did a simple test with 2 identical falmeless candles that run on 2 AAs. Amazon Basics AA kept the candle going as long and bright as brand new Energizers. Pretty darn good deal!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These were super reasonably priced. They last about as long as the dollar store ones, so if you have wall clocks or remotes that need 'em, you're good. If you have high-drain stuff, they'll burn up pretty quick. But it's still cool to have tons of AAs on hand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far so good. I haven't noticed them dying fast so they are much better than your off brand cheap knock off ones. We shall see how long they last.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was surprised, pretty good batteries!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Sent these to my grandson to go with the gifts I sent him for Christmas. His mom was thrilled because there were more than enough batteries to accomodate his remotes etc.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I bought these batteries as back ups. I normally use rechargeable AA Batteries. I got tired of being the only person in my house to recharge batteries as soon as they die and of people taking my charged batteries out of my controller. I only ordered an 8 pack and have had to use them in a dvd remote, my controller and two thermostats (yep, they both decided to die on me at the same time). I can't tell a difference between these AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries and the name brand ones I normally buy. For the price these are pretty good batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We use them on a battery operated fan on high. Fan says on high will run for about 11 hours before needing new batteries. These last for two nights, after first night it is running down but still keeps going. Pretty cool"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Not bad. I cannot verify how awesome they are, but I'm not complaining about dead batteries all the time, so they must be pretty good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Very long lasting, pretty sure I'll order again sometine"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good price, time will tell on durability"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Price and Quality Tops
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,price is good... look good on paper.. some i have are bad.. after few times use .won't buy again unless quality goes up..
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Order these regularly. Work very well. Price is great as with 3 kids replacing batteries often.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Great batteries for great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great price on necessary item, seems to have environmentally friendly packaging. They are easy to store, as the box is flat and about the size of a small book. Performance of the batteries has been unremarkable, I don't have a sense that they last longer or shorter than any others and I've no convenient way to assess that. I'd prefer a built-in battery-life indicator, but that would surely increase the price, and I can just use a battery tester. I noticed that a favorite YouTube tech reviewer Linus Sebastian uses them, and he's a frugal fellow that reassures me that I made a good choice. I recommend them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Ok, batteries but can't beat the price"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,GOOD QUILTY PRICE GREAT
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best price I could find anywhere. Not sure on performance yet.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"What can I say about batteries, they work, priced well."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Priced well and work great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I haven't even used one yet but I suspect they will work. I stocked up on these because I have a lot of stuff that uses AAA's and it is a super price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Not quite the performance I would expect from a product that Amazon puts it's name on. A bit dissapointed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"When I opened the pack and put them in a device, it already said battery low."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Product as described
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,This is sth i never had with other serious brands. disappointing and returning
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Trying to contact seller. Product very tarnished and rusty like it's been used or very old. Very disappointed by appearance and quality
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Pros*Good quality*Good valueCons*None
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good testing fully charged
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,purchased in sept 2015 went to change because light was not working . batteries leaked and ruined a special optical light . now checking all other light they are in .
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"this was an ouststanding deal. I bought it through Alexa voice order. since I didn't get the Alexa price for some reason, I contacted amazon customer service and Amazon corrected the problem quickly, without more information and effort on my part. I *love* that about amazon.the batteries were in a plain box, wrapped in four packs. I often buy amazonbasics, both for the quality and the simple, clean packaging. I use a lot of aa batteries in items that do not work with my rechargeables. I don't mind finding space for 48. in fact the box of 48 requires just a little more space than a 20-24 pack of other batteries since other batteries use more packaging.put these in your wish list or save for later in your cart and watch for a great price to buy them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Put these into a high power flashlight and took my dog out. Within ten minutes the flashlight was so dim that it was worthless. I would never buy these again!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Quality batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These batteries seem to hold up as well as any other batteries I've used and they are cheaper than the name brand batteries I had been using.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I purchased AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries in July. It has now been two and a half months since I have been using them. They are definitely comparable to the leading brands out there. They are also much more affordable. We have used them in everyday items that need batteries. We mainly use them in our remote controls. Before, it always felt like we were replacing our batteries constantly or hunting for batteries. It was nice to buy this pack to have them readily available and also have the option to purchase recurring delivery if we need them...which is something I will definitely consider because of the convenience. I just need to figure out now how often I need them. This pack has lasted awhile."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are good quality batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought these basically because they are by Amazon and I love and trust their brand to produce high quality products. So I bought packs of AA and AAA when I bought some flashlights on Prime Day. They seem to work great and I expect they will last a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Easy to open and store . . . equivalent battery life with more expensive brands!For those of us who do not like 'real' shopping These are Amazon Prime 2 day delivery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Quality and Quantity worth every penny
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,delivered on time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Basic batteries at a good price. It is such a convenience to have them delivered to me. I will be reordering them for sure.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Quality batteries at a great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries. Work and last like brand name batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Quality batteries, great price. Perfect buy for a household with toddlers. Also the packaging is great-easy to keep the new batteries in and use when needed. No loose batteries rolling around everywhere once you open it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries get the job done for a reasonable price. While I haven't done extensive comparative testing, these seem to last about as long as the typical name brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are so expensive. It's great that Amazon came out with their own brand that is cost effective and has great quality! I've only used a few of them so far but they are definitely long lasting! Will reorder again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,very good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I Ordered these to use in my flashes to shoot a wedding. They are with out a doubt the worst batteries I've ever used. They'd last for maybe 30 to 40 shots, and they would start to over heat. I have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot, they would burn you.Typically I can run though a wedding with energizer batters (4 AA) and only have to swap batteries once. I went through this entire pack, and had to go buy more at a store. Which the ones I bought later caused no issues and finished out the night.Very displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with. I will never buy these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I purchased an 8-pack back in April. I used 2 right away in a remote and put the remaining 6 up in a cabinet. Last night (3 months later) I went to replace batteries in another remote and all 6 were dead. I purchased another box of batteries from a local store, installed them in the remote the remote worked great. Definitely a quality issue on some of these batteries based on other reviews."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I knew that Amazon had essentials for sale, but I never thought they would be selling batteries! Much cheaper than name brands out there and have been just as good to me. None has been a dud on me so far so I'm pretty satisfied."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I needed some regular batteries to toss into random things where my rechargeables normally get lost and forgotten. Normally I prefer amazon's brand, but these white batteries were just not that great. Some of them barely worked. They were very inconsistent."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries, especially for the price. I buy all my batteries through Amazon now."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"For small amount of money, one gets quality AND quantity...really satisfied :)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Quality seems good. I just wish the buttons lit up on the bagel and frozen buttons. Also, the slots aren't long enough or deep enough for a good sized bagel."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,To be honest...these batteries outperformed a big name brand. Period.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,I think the price is really good for the amount. But I feel the battery life is not as long as my preferred choice of battery. Will go back to my original choice of batteries.Besides that I did not have any issues with them and they are perfectly good working batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These batteries are very iffy. I have Mag-Lite's that require 3 AAA batteries and they have always drained the batteries equally, not with these batteries. I tried using my Mag-Lite this AM and it was dead. Did I leave it on and set it on it's end Nope. I checked the batteries and 2 of them were still good, but the 3rd wouldn't even register any voltage. This has happened 3 times with 2 different Mag-Lite XL200's and these batteries.Will not purchase again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I thought I was getting a great deal, but I learned the hard way if you don' use them up quickly, they go dead in a hurry. Extremely limited shelf life so don't buy these in bulk if you don't plan to use them w/ in 6 mo.s. If your using them in medical equipment, I'm sorry to say I'm choosing another battery. I don't like bashing an Amazon product and there's always the chance I got a bad batch but in this instance, (medical equipment) you want power when you need, I had several groans from the bfrnd about his TV remotes eating up his batteries, I thought my wireless mice were eating them up as well, so I bought another mouse, but when I put 2 fresh packs in my ten's unit 4 ea. time they started out weak then didn't last 15 min ea.. set it's time to choose another brand of battery not the product your putting it in. I did test the one's I took out before putting the new one's in. I didn't think to test them before putting them in....."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I've been ordering these since Amazon started to provide their own product as having a 1 year old means you always need to have batteries available at the drop of a hat! Never had any issues and always fast fulfillment on Amazon's end!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal for our office's most popular battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Quick delivery of a good product.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Glad I ordered this many. I had no idea I'd use nearly half the box as soon as I opened it. Now I need to do the same with AA size as many applications say specifically not to use rechargeables. Believe them! I tried it once before and pretty much melted down the item and destroyed the batteries as well. Apparently they are not made to supply as much current and they will let out the (magic) smoke. These came in quickly and are just what I needed
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I saw reviews for batteries on the news and these were rated among best. I'm so glad I can get these from Amazon in bulk for a great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Haven't used many of them yet, but the two or three have have used seem to be fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Last as long as the brand names at a fraction of the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"As far as batteries go, these are just as good as any others you'll find in the store. They do the trick! So far, I've been super excited about the Amazon Basics stuff that has been coming out and have been satisfied with everything I've tried from them. Can't wait to try some more stuff."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I am not a bettery expert nor an electrician. There are a few things that I consider when shopping for a battery - shelf life, price and brand. When you buy a brand product, you are most certainly guaranteed a good long lasting battery. Hence I always bought energizer or Duracell. Amazon is also a big brand so I decided to give it a try and to be honest with you it's a great battery. Price wise, it's cheaper than other name brands. One other andvreallyninportant factor is the shelf life. This battery has a shelf life of ten years, while a lot of batteries have 5 year shelf life. This is important for someone who uses batteries on a less frequent basis, such as for remote control. I started using batteries more frequently since I have a ton of baby toys now and a lot of them require batteries.One thought that came to mind while I was writing this review is that I just wanted to share a quick and easy way to check if battery is dead or not. All you need to do is hold the battery over flat surface (let's say kitchen countertop) at one or so inches high and drop it vertically on the flatter side. If it drops and falls over it is dead. If it falls and stays vertical it is still good to go. A friend of mine told me this trick and it totally works!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best battery deal ever. Lasts a long time
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,really good price for good batteries not the best but at a ourth of the price ..ill take theses any day
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good quality and long lasting batteries. No problems and I will order again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are a great price based on others I've seen. They additionally have a very good life cycle based on individual price point as compared to more expensive brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Really great value for batteries. So far have tried 12 of the 48 batteries I ordered and they are all working perfectly fine just like Alkaline batteries should. The box they came in was great and I love the no frills specialty that Amazon gives with these. There's no forced marketing on you to buy more of their batteries and the packaging was great. The price was fantastic for the 48 pack which would normally cost at least 5 - 10 more at a retail store for 24 batteries.Like I said, performance-wise these are great. I may order some of the rechargeable batteries in the future."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought an amope foot roller thingy and it was so weak I almost threw it away but hubby said to just change the batteries bc they were probably old. I put in some rayovac ones I had that were brand new and made it weaker than the ones already in it. I had just ordered these batteries bc of a great deal that was going on. I put them in the amope and they were very strong! I have to say I was surprised.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They've been great batteries so far, since my wife uses a TI-84 and goes through duracells like no one's business. So, the subscribe and save feature saves me from getting yelled at for not having any batteries in the house, as well as she seems to be getting a bit more juice from them.Definitely recommended, especially if you're currently buying batteries from box stores."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I really wanted to love the Amazon AA batteries but they just are not durable enough for my usage. As a night time long distance runner, I have LED headlamps with a rear red flashing light that I use which require 3 AA batteries.I usually purchase Duracell or Energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well. Rechargeable batteries are not very good in LED Headlamps so those are out.The problem with the Amazon batteries is that I get about 8 or 9 hours of strong light, then it really fades fast. The longest I have used the Amazon batteries is 11 hours and by then, the light is less than 40 brightness. The other issue I noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced. When I test the batteries with a tester, they are only 1/2 way through the green range.Duracell and Energizers give me nearly 16 - 18 hours at full brightness and maybe 3 or 4 hours with 40. I have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries. When I test the batteries after the light is reduced, they are in the yellow or red area.The Amazon Batteries give me two less than the Energizers and Duracells which is significant. I average 5 night time runs with the Duracells and Energizers and 2, sometimes 3 with Amazon Batteries.These may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices, but if it has to drive a light or a motor, you may want to skip these.The light pictures show new, 5 and 9 hours.The 2nd light shows new and 4 hours.The battery tester shows new, 4, 8 and 11 hours."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"So far, so good. I like how Amazon provides reliable basics that I can easily order through Prime and save myself a trip to the store."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice batteries for a fair price. I purchased these to include 3 new batteries for each mini flashlight I add to the Operation Christmas Child Shoe Boxes that are sent to over 100 countries for children in need. I will have 1 battery in each flashlight and 2 spares for the child.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work great although they don't last super long they do last a good amount of time. not only that they are budget-friendly

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They seem to work well and with a 10 year shelf life why buy in two and 4 packs when you can save money like this.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These have served us well here, batteries that recharge are economical for us in our family of four. Especially with two toddlers and all of their toys.When these are priced affordably, I can definitely recommend them to everyone. Makes my wallet happy when I find affordability and performance in a product being used constantly in our home."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"When I heard one of the consumer gurus on the radio a few years ago saying that some of the generic or lesser known brands of batteries were often as good as the name brands, I tried a pack of the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries instead of the usual name brand. I've bought several packs since then, and although I haven't done any objective testing, they appear to be about as long-lasting and reliable as any other brands that I've tried. Some of the batteries were installed a couple of years ago, and they still have some charge, and there's been no leakage or corrosion. I've been very pleased with the AmazonBasics alkaline batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The life of these batteries is really astonishing, I bought these quite a while ago and we still have so many left. I was tired of buying small packs at the store, just to run out a couple weeks later. These batteries last long and the fact that I can buy them in packs of 100 is honestly the best feeling."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Last fairly long, comparable to other batteries I have purchased in the past. They come neatly in a cardboard box and are a steal for the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I have switched to AmazonBasics brand after trying just about every brand there is. Good, reliable batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great Amazon Basics quality at a terrific price. I've come to rely on Amazon Basics for superb prices and dependable, excellent quality."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Quality and battery life is the same as name brand. Reminds me of the days when you could go to Radio Shack and get some good, inexpensive batteries. So far, I haven't had an AmazonBasics products I haven't liked."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Long lasting product good bang for your buck.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love the price. They seem as good as Duracells.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Perfectly respectable battery.I have been using Duracell batteries almost exclusively since I first went to sea in the 1970s. No complaints then. Still no complaints.I bought some of these AmazonBasics batteries just to try them out. Nothing scientific--other reviewers have done that well enough.Basically I'm satisfied. When I'm at sea I'll probably stick with Duracells, but these Amazon Basics are getting the job done at home."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Cheap, works, better quality then duracel."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good as Rayovac

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Don't seem to last as long as the big name brands, however, for the price you will get more run time per money spent."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Every bit as good as the high end brands but at a price that is more affordable. We use these in Halloween displays and know that the copper ones last about 3.5-4 hours these made it the same amount of time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Save your money, they don't last very long"

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So... One day I was camping in the Wild West on the Rocky Mountains in Colorado... I was carrying my trusty Power Rangers limited edition collectors sword. Out of nowhere... A bear attacked me. I grabbed my trusty sword, but it was out of batteries so it did not make the swoosh sounds that adds to the effect of my swing. So I hurriedly went to my trusty AmazonBasics AA batteries, and switched out the ones in my Power Rangers sword. My swooshing sounds were amazing, and I escaped with my life (not my leg but that's okay). Thank you AmazonBasics AA Batteries for saving a life."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Important Part missing - the power cordStained and 2 different colored remotesNot acceptable
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These seem to last as long as any named brand battery. I'm not sure what will happen with corrosion in the long term storage items - I'll post more if they show corrosion issues.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,seem fine. doing the job. haven't had long enough to know if they'll last as long as name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seem like good batteries and a fair price.Just seems like they are always out of stock and thentakes a long time to ship them out when the do have them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seem like normal batteries to me
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seem okay. Too soon to tell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Work very well and seem to last
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Seem to last , time will tell will up date later."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seem to last/perform as well as the other brand you're thinking of right now and probably a better price. At least that's why I ordered them again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seem to be working out as promised. I just purchased them within the lst month and used reviews of others to choose them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They seem to work as well as name brand batteries. Good price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seem to work fine
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Seem to work just fine. Just as good as the big name brand batteries from what I can tell, maybe a bit better.I like the packaging."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,batteries are batteries. Seemed like a good price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Seemed to die very fast.I only purchased amazon batteries about 6 months ago and already replaced them in more than one device that should last quite a bit longer.Noticed the same for the AAA
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"seems just as good as higher-priced batteries. I have had good experience with an AmazonBasics wireless mouse I've been using for 1 1/2 years, and the reviews for these batteries are excellent. For the price, I am fully satisfied."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seems like a very good buy
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"expiration of 2026, about 9 years in advance of when I received these.Batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of 5 which is good to provide for protection from discharge after part of the package is opened."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I ordered a 20 pack of AA batteries from amazon when they were on sale. Seems like my kids are going through batteries like crazy with their gaming controllers and such. My household ends up going through AA batteries like there is no tomorrow! So when i saw these were on sale, i had to order some. I decided to hide these ones from the kids, so i could see if they were comparable to the store bought batteries that seem to always die on us rather quickly. So far my husband has had a set of these batteries in his xbox controller for days now and they are still going strong. Same with the wii controller- which has a battery indicator even, still says full battery. So far, i am very happy with these batteries and plan to purchase more in the future!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Seems like quality varies. Some of the batts work great and las long and in the same device some fail quickly
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries and they work. Use them for camping lights.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Bout to go with an rc truck. Seems to be holding power as good as Energizer
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seems to be working as well as the duracell ones that I purchase from Costco. Comparable value and I didn't have to go to the store for them!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far these batteries seem to hold up decently compared to more expensive name brands. Time will tell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,seems to last as long as other batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seems to work fine
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great Bargain, were shipped on time and the packing was good with no damage, happy customer"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Several if these were dead but majority are good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"A gift, she is very happy with them!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,as good as Duracell and the Bunny
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Shipped fast and so far lasting like other major brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheaper than buying at WallyMart and sent directly to my home! Shipped quickly and in a nice packaging. They have lasted pretty well so far. This bundle was better than the packs you see in stores that promise an additional 5 free batteries. Got more for my buck and they work greatly. Def. would recommend.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. Out of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,short battery life
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,They don't last very long.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Cheap batteries, but they don't last long for me. I've been using them in my fire tv remote. I have to replace them every month. The batteries before these lasted for 6 months for comparison."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Didn't seem to last long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Noticed short life and not enough power for some items
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These batteries do not have a long life.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These things only last about a week in a Roku remote I will not be reordering.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"They had such positive reviews, I suppose it's possible that I got a bad batch. I've bought the Maxcell brand quite a bit which is slightly cheaper than these and I 'd compare them to Rayovak, not quite Duracell, but good. These lasted less than half as long, crazy! I had high hopes as an Amazon fan. Sad."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,they last about half as long as duracell batteries do. they are cheap but they are not worth it.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They really don't last very long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Batteries last about a week in a wall clock- name brands last six months. Don't waste your money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I was disappointed with these batteries. I thought they were going to be a higher quality and work as well as the name brand batteries. I bought these to use in my sons' leapster GS explorers. My sons do not play on them nonstop and they shut off on their own after being idle for a few minutes. These batteries don't even last 3 days. 8 hrs of use at the most! Because we can't afford to go through batteries so quickly, I change them once a week. It's really sad that they don't hold up longer. Time to go back to brand name as it will save money over these and use some rechargables. Do not buy if you plan on using these for something more than a remote or clock."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"We have been extremely disappointed in these batteries. Put them in our game camera and they were dead after two weeks. Should have lasted two or three months. Same thing with everything we have used these batteries for. Don't waste your money, Buy Duracell instead."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Batteries don't last very long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These batteries don't last long at all.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Dont last very long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,They didn't last the Christmas season....not even half of it.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,In Firestick remote it lasts about a week before replacement is required. Digging deeper alkaline batteries only last as long as they retain the upper percentage of their voltage. Either I have a bad batch or these degrade quickly in remotes. I plan on asking Amazon why this basic is so short lived in peak voltage retention.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"10 year storage life is a joke. I had some that I purchased only 8 months ago and when I went to use them, they already have zero juice left in them. I double checked with a battery tester and got zippo - zero. Not recommended."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"So at first I was happy, but my computer mouse started flashing red (low battery) about a week of having the new battery. Not impressed with battery life, but it works short term."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These batteries seemed to last about half as long as (Wegmans) store-brand AA batteries. Not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing that it's so many in a package. Disappointing.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"should have bought the bigger pack, used most of these up already, forgot how much stuff I had that uses AAA batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are just as good as Duracell or Eveready brands. So much cheaper to subscribe to these than giving up the big bucks at the store, and having to run out and get them too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love AmazonBasics items - they're just the basics and do their job. These batteries are no exception. The price is good, and the battery life is on par with other manufacturers. I'm happy with these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Can't beat for the price. Simple packaging and performs like any there battery.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Simple, basic batteries. They do the job and they do it well. The charge is on par with many of the brand name batteries. A little bit more expensive than what I would prefer and that is why I give it 4 stars."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"A high quality product, right up there with any of the main name brand batteries. These batteries are long lasting, and reliable. Though the order is a bulk one, these are shrink wrapped into packs of 4, which is super convenient for grab and go situations. I would recommend this product, and I will buy again!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Very convenient, high quality, good price. Why not subscribe"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I use AA batteries in my double electric breast pump. I usually have to replace Duracell every 3-4 days but these I had to replace every 24 hours or so. Truly did not last long!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good. Only had these for ten days, and they work just great.Here is an update on these batteries. Having purchased a couple sets of these over time, I can honestly say you get your moneys worth with these batteries. I am not compensated in any way for my reviews, it is just an honest review of this product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Small for size,, and already separating from waistband. Will not buy again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I purchased plastic battery storage cases for the batteries I had been purchasing that came on a flat piece of cardboard covered by a plastic lid. When I lifted the plastic to get a battery, other batteries tumbled out and soon I had a mess in my battery drawer. However, Amazon's batteries are very special from the minute you receive it. They arrive in a small cardboard box that just fits in your hand and opens easily from the top for removal of a battery or two. They will never fall out of the box and make a mess. I have not had a problem with using the batteries like I did when purchasing a brand from a big box store that carried its name -- the batteries leaked inside my TV remote control and made a white stain on the top of my entertainment center. Since I use the remote every day, the batteries were not left alone long enough for this to happen but it did. I went around the apartment removing those batteries from every item I own and did not want to be ruined, cleaned the mess inside the remote and vowed never to purchase batteries from that store again -- not even the name brands they often sell -- my revenge on the store for causing a white mark on my furniture -- a petty but satisfying act that was my small way of paying back. Amazon goes to great pains to see that its shipments come in containers that are easy for its customers to open and I appreciate that and am happy to see that they have carried that philosophy to include even small boxes containing their AmazonBasics Batteries. Good Job Amazon and thank you."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Rechargeable batteries are something everyone needs. Small devices like remote controls will use up a lot of conventional batteries throughout a lifetime, so these batteries were something I really needed. These last long, and they retain charge for a good amount of time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Loved the price and when received that there were actually smaller packages of four instead of a bulk pack. Better price than Sam's or Walmart at the time of this review.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work the same as all the big name brands with a cheaper cost and not having to drive to the store.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You never really realize how many batteries you go through until you get these. I feel so great knowing that I wont run out anytime soon! Especially great when you need an emergency battery change.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,An excellent buy for the amount of batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,SO BAD DO NOT EVEN LAST TWO MONTHS IN A MOUSE....A MOUSE!!!!!That's what I call utter garbage. Would return if possible.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Dollar store Sunbeam batteries lasted longer than these crappy things. So disappointing!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon rulesHaha
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far I love these batteries. You can't beat the price and they seem to work just as well as name brand. I've used them in various toys, remotes, and household necessities with no issues whatsoever. I plan on ordering all my batteries from amazon going forward."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far I'm impressed! Holding up very well. Great price. I will be buying other sizes when it time to order.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good price. Too early to say how they last, but if they do, great deal better than the name brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good quality for a good price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Hope they lasts as described.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I bought these after reading the reviews. They came nicely packaged. No issues so far with the things we have been using them for (toys, remotes). Will update if we have any issues."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've only had these batteries for a few days....they seem great they work! The price is great compared to the dollar store. If my opinion changes, I will update"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seems to be good batteries so far
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far so good on battery life and shipping program. Love that these come in an easy to access box with stress free packaging. I'm still measuring them against my name brands but do wish there was an offering in rechargeable.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"So far so good, will update rating when finished"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good. These batteries seem to work well at a fraction of the price of name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good. Will update if anything changes.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far so good....work as well as brand name batteries and cost much less
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Time will tell how well they perform. They are a little less expensive than Energizer and if they perform as well I'll re-order them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Working good so far. Haven't had any of them to be leaking or dead yet bilingual haven't used them all either.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far so good BUT the test of a good battery is how long they last so stand by for an update later.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so Good !
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"so far so good, but a little early to tell if they will measure up to top brand for less money"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good, great value for batteries and they seem to be working just as well as the others!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good, had issues with duracells leaking, not noticing any less performance and no leakers :)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Typically I buy ProCell batteries... but, I decided to give these a try based upon independent reviews. So for I have been pleased with their performance but it has been limited to use in remotes so far."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No issues thus far. I just started using them so I speak for their longevity.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Only time will tell if they work as good as their price. I'll update the review when I know more.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work. So far so good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good. Great value. Well packaged, nice clean design and arrived quickly."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good. Haven't had long enough to say if they last long or not. Liked price and the amount in package.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good. The charge seems decent on these (I was afraid they wouldn't last long). I haven't had to replace any yet. For the price, I'm very happy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good...good value overall time will tell how long they will last but will update if they don't last as long as name brands
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I haven't calculated the life VS cost break-even, but these have worked well in all of my devices. I would order again just because of the bargain and convenience."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far the batteries work as good as the more expensive name brands. I love all of the Amazon Basics stuff I've ordered so far!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far these batteries have been good even on my little girl's toys. I was afraid of trying them because of the reviews they don't last long... but so far I like them and I'll be getting more when running low.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,so far these batteries seem to do well.... they were a little more expensive than the memorex batteries but I wanted to try them.... so far so good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is my first time purchasing Amazon batteries. I decided to give them a try as the set that came with my Fire TV lasted a long time. So far they are great. They last about the same amount of time as Duracel and Energizer branded batteries. I'm always leary of off brand batteries as I've had several bad experiences. These Amazon batteries are great. No leaks yet. Great buy!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'm using three now and so far they're good. I love the flat sturdy box they came. Perfect for storing. Also a lot more batteries than I realized. :-)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I have been using these batteries for about a month now and the half I have used have performed very well. The Batteries I inserted into 3 items when they arrived are still working.So far I have found no bad batteries included in my order.Would recommend based on performance of the batteries I have used so far.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No problems so far.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far these batteries are just as great as other brands I've had and the price can't be beat. I bought two packs of 48 count. I was serious.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"So far, so good.Good price. Good performance.....so far."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Got these for some LED motion lights. So fare working great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, so good, first time we bought these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, so good!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Just started using them. So far, so good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"So far, so good."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, so good. I haven't had them in a device long enough to report on actual battery life."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"so far, so good. Seem to work as well as any I've bought and I definitely like the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, so good. These arrived quickly and are well packaged. They seem just as powerful as their name brand counterparts. Think these will do just fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, so good. They all seem fully charged and last as expected."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So many batteries for reasonable price! So happy about it!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So many batteries for the price. Will take me years to use it all
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Enough batteries to power my remote for a decade. I would have loved this many AAs for my Gameboy growing up.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works great in my xbox controllers and wii controls!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So much more affordable than even big box stores and last just as long as name brand batteries. I will only buy batteries from Amazon from now on.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So nice having a huge pack of batteries in the house. I never run out. These work super great!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,not long lasting move on pay more get more
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,so so
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Good price for batteries except it seems like they don't last near as long as name brand
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"these batteries are ok but do not seem to have much power over time compared to the copper top brand. bought them for game controllers, so the family seems go through them like water"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I usually buy the 5.00 24 battery special at Harbor Freight, but they were not on sale when I needed some, so I decided to get theseBoth of the batteries are supposed to be Alkaline, so you would think they would both last about the same length of time NO SOI use these in a Personal Pedi Callused Skin grinder, so they get a good workoutAMAZON's batteries just don't last as long.... and it's a NOTICEABLE differenceI'm going back to Harbor Freight's Alkaline's"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,My kids go thru a lot of batteries. These are good for the wii remote and other items that do not draw a huge power source but flash lights and the such seem to go thru them a lot faster.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"So, I saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for 48 of this alkaline batteries. Yeah, well, NOW I am startled by how long they last. Uh-oh, make that DON'T last. I don't take but 20 to 30 shots from my little Finepix camera before the lens starts closing when I try to shoot. Compare that to...well, I'm not gonna lie. I never counted, but I took TONS of shots using Duracell alkaline bats. Conservative estimate At least 300 shots for each set of two. Einstein not needed to do the math on that. I just looked and see that they are made in Indonesia, which may or may not matter, since I don't know where Duracells are made. I still have 34 of these lousy things left. Ticks me off, royally!!!(Now, let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Low price, high quality, fast delivery. Can't argue with anything in the AmazonBasics line in my experience so far."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are pretty good have a long life would recommend
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"SOLID BATTERIES, GREAT PRICING"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price and the product quality has been superb. Buy again - yes!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I don't think I can find cheaper Alkaline batteries to be honest. Their life is pretty good too.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Sleek design. Comes with batteries needed. I've compared the number to another scale that same day hours later and it displayed the same number. I'd say it's very accurate. Clear display, thin black platform. Your typical scale. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my honest opinion. I'd buy again and would recommend to a friend. Solid product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,This is a solid product from Amazon Basic. I will happily order these again and again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I'll give them two stars for the price, but you really do get what you pay for. These batteries seemed to die a lot faster than the Kirkland ones I got from Costco. Or, maybe it's just some of them that fail too soon. I put several new Amazon AA batteries in a few different devices that get a good amount of use. When a couple of those devices stopped working, I tested the batteries. In both cases, only one battery was actually dead, the other was fine. That seems weird, weird enough that I'll go back to Costco for my next battery purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I don't know if I just got a bad batch or not, but some of these batteries are partially discharged. I opened a pack of 4, put them in a device and it gave me a low battery indication. I swapped them out with 4 more from the same box and they worked."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Several of the (new) batteries do not work. Very frustrating to replace a battery in an appliance and gave it not work and not know whether the problem is the appliance or the battery. Plus some things require several batteries and so it is hard to figure out which battery is not functional...I've experienced this with a couple devices (one wireless mouse and one kids toy) and trying different batteries resolves it, so I'm pretty confident the problem is the batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Came with only 12 of the 36 batteries in the box. Someone can't count. Two previous orders came with all 36, which warrants a 3 rating overall I suppose."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Lots of batteries, but I am going through them pretty quickly. I will switch to a higher quality battery on my next order."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries are great for remotes, but I'm on the fence when it comes to a video game controller. Since I can't say how many actual hours of performance we are getting per use in the controller, I've just noticed that there are more frequent trips to the closet to replace them than usual. Although, it was over the summer and game time was higher than usual."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Just opened a brand new box of Amazon AAA batteries 100 count . Sorry Amazon, but I had to open several packages of 4 only to discover. That most of the brand new batteries contained in the box arrived DEAD. I put a meter on the batteries to check for voltage. Some read 1v DC some read 0v dc and some read 2. volts. The batteries I removed from my head set were weak but at least had 1 volt As you can see in the photo the freshness date states 12-2026. . I certainly expect to find more dead batteries in that box. I don't have the time to check each package of 4 right now. Not good Amazon. I am concerned, because I purchase your packages of 9 volts and packages of AA as well. will I be surprised and disappointed as well"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These don't last long, wouldn't buy again. Spend the extra money get good batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very happy with their performance thus far for the price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Same quality as other Alkaline brand, not much to say, it is a standard alkaline battery with AMAZON brand on it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They are batteries at a good price that work. I did not do any sort of power level tests or anything, but they seem fine for general use."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I haven't used this brand yet, so I can't rate the use, however for my needs, they are exactly what I was looking for, long life, expiration date, grouped by 4, perfect for long term storage,"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,starting to really like some of the Amazon basic stuff - these seem to work well for around the house remotes and small draw items like that.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,as good as any brand name battery for a much better price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Lasted less than half the time of a Duracell alkaline battery in the same conditions. (LED candles, on continuously)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Bought AmazonBasics for all the new toys my kids were getting for Christmas, all of which have had to be replaced in the past couple months. Life of this battery isn't great."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good!, I put dates on these batteries to check the life line when installed into batteries power items. I'll have future updates on this items. Stand by!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,working good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Got enough now for any possible hurricane, tornado, earthquake, and other disasters that take out the electricity. YOU can never have too many batteries, just in case."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Needed AA batteries. Best price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have bought these Amazon batteries a few times. It is just so convenient. And you might as well just keep batteries stocked and by this big one. Especially around the holidays. There is nothing more painful than when you 8 year old gets something new and you have to search the house for some other device that contains AA batteries. Just buy these. And when you run out, order them again. Why stress yourself out over running to the store for AA batteries when your child is screaming and crying over their remote control car. These last a long time as far as I can tell. I have rarely replaced them so far."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Quite pleased with the longevity. I have a digital camera that eats batteries like a fat kid eats chocolate cake. If I was attending a concert or a family event, I'd take at least one spare pair of batteries as a back-up, which eventually ends up costing a small fortune. Although I've not done any scientific tests, these seem to last twice as long as what I was using and the price is much cheaper. These will definitely be my new go to batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Brand new batteries that are very affordable come in a nice cartoon box stack. Work as expected.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Xbox remote. The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them 3x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work as well as any batteries I've purchased for the things I need batteries in. We have these shipped automatically using Subscribe and Save and I it is nice to ALWAYS have batteries on hand!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good stuff here
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So many batteries and they last a decent amount of time. Such a better price than going to the store!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Very nice packaging! Love the price and the nice convenient packaging makes it easy to store, find and keep track of the batteries. Great job Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Conforms to the widely-accepted AA size.Fits where all my name-brand AA batteries fit.So far have incurred no damage to my home or pets from their use.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Of the 6 I used so far, out of the box and wrapper, completely dead... thanks..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Arrived and maybe only 1/3 of the batteries actually worked. The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,work very well...super charge
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Much better deal than you can get anywhere else
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As promised. Super fast shipping.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Just what I wanted. Last long enough to consider it as my preferred AAA batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These were a really good buy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Super happy with Amazon batteries. Great Price! Batteries work just as good as other big brands. You won't be disappointed. I sure love them, and would definately purchase more in the future!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are lasting as long as the big name brands...super impressed and will buy again! At the rate we go through batteries (4 children age 7 and under with the corresponding battery operated toys) this is a great find.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Last forever! Super pleased!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I cannot believe how inexpensive these are. We've been using rechargeables (which are about 2.50 each) because batteries are so expensive, but these work great and for so cheap! With a toddler who burns thru all our batteries with lightening speed I cannot begin to tell you how thrilled I am with these. Not sure how long they last but hey, you get what you pay for."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have quite buying batteries anywhere else. These are long-lasting, superior batteries at an excellent price. Why buy elsewhere when they are available at Amazon and I don't even have to go to the store to get them!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far these batteries have outlasted the Duracell batteries they replaced in my Xbox remote, at a fraction of the cost!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"can't beat the price, but i could sweat my energizers last a little longer. i'll shoot from the hip here: i think the dollars/output is better than energizers, but if battery life is the only real variable i might go with commercial battery brands. please note- this is not carefully measures, just first glance based on kids playing with toys..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nicely packaged and full of powerExcellent service. Batteries are freshly manufactured.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,My son goes through batteries like water so these are the perfect solution
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I thought these might not last as long bc they weren't name brand, but they were surprisingly wonderful! I'll definitely buy again!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Got a prime membership and decided because I didn't have to pay for shipping this would be a good deal, cheaper then battery's in the store. Well these are equal if not bettter then the duracells. Would recommend to a friend."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We go thru a lot of batteries, seems to be a very good battery at a great price. Would recommend!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Talk about Power ! its Amazon ! no need.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,bought for work use. techs go through batteries like crazy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I went through all 48 in less than 2 weeks. I can't lie and say they were awesome, when they were not."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Terrible - The product lasts less than a week in a home weather station, regardless if warm or cold weather. Cheap Rayovac batteries work just fine and I will stick with buying those locally at Menards."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Worst batteries I've ever used. I used them in a sensor light. They only worked l l/2 months while my prior Energizer batteries had worked for 5 l/2 months. I can see why these batteries are so cheap. I definitely would NOT recommend them to anyone.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Terrible decision on my part to trust Amazon to make even a decent battery. How hard can it be, right Batteries don't last. Every device I've used them in began to have quirky little malfunctions (remote buttons don't always work or do what they are supposed to do, mouse randomly disconnects from computer, etc.). Maybe I got a bad batch -- all 48 of them. Lesson learned."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I tried using these on my mini mist diffuser, amazon basics batteries discharges easily within a week. This is terrible in comparison to energizer batteries which lasts at least 3 months."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Ok, terrible life span."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Terrible!! The batteries drained way too fast. We put them in wreaths with lights and went dead within 2 days. They were timed for 4 hours so it's not on for long. We used Energizer batteries last year and worked for the 20 days that were on display and didn't have to change any. But I guess for 24 for 100 you get what you pay for. Will not buy these again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,terrific
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price and fast delivery. I tested four of the batteries and each measured 1.62 VDC.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love my batteries !!!! Thank You
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"As other reviewer commented, thank you, these batteries expiration date was 5+ years off when we purchased them. We've not had any problems with any of them. Many applications just do not do well with those rechargeable batteries, so these fit the bill nicely."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It sure is nice never running out of batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You cannot get a better deal on batteries than this. I have found they last a long time and are just as good as any brand name.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Thank You!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I think most of the batteries I have in my house are now all AmazonBasics. These batteries are in all of our toys, gadgets, remotes and I have never had an issue. They last as long as expected."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great battery awesome price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great price and Amazon has become a reliable name in our household. You know when you get something that has the Amazon Basics logo on it it will not only work properly it will also last as long or even better than any competitor. Thank you once again Amazon!I think most of the batteries I have in my house are now all AmazonBasics. These batteries are in all of our toys, gadgets, remotes and I have never had an issue. They last as long as expected."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great product at a great price! As usual, Amazon is amazing!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I was so glad to see these batteries in large quantities on amazon!!! I am so tired of paying so much for them at local retailers for packages much smaller. I plan on buying them from here from now on and keeping all my battery operated candles and lights in full use! The only reason I did not give these a 5 star rating is that I haven't used them yet but I usually by generic brands from the locals so these are probably going to be a better quality.Our household really goes through these daily for remotes, candles, string lights whatever....you name it we need batteries for it. :)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Thanks for your review
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,thanks
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,thanks for quality batteries. prolonged electronics life by a lot.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Doesn't get easier than this. Good products shipped to my office free, in two days:)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The AmazonBasics brand has some really nice products and the batteries definitely fall within that category. Inexpensive and they last long too. Its nice to be able to buy in bulk and not break the bank and always have plenty of spare batteries in the cabinet for kids toys/gadgets.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great buy- batteries where at my front door step with in 2 days
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are great, not too costly, and just get the job done. I also like the packaging where the bacterias are stored. I would switch out the new battery with my old ones and put the old ones back in the slot of the packaging. It keeps them together. I'm not sure if there are places that recycle these type of batteries around, but if there were it would make buying these a total must."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The batteries appear to be working great. I've been using two AA's in my Xbox One controller for over a month now. If you can get a sale on these like I did, buy, buy, buy!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,The batteries are good and I have enjoyed the use of them but why do you package 4 batterie at a time with plastic. It's a hassle to unwrap. I feel like they are prepackaged for a trip to mars
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work just as well as name brand batteries while being substantially cheaper. These are also packaged well. The cardboard box is slim and holds its shape unlike a normal plastic battery box. The batteries are shrink-wrapped together so they stay nicely in place. I just take some from the end and leave the remaining batteries nicely in their package.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run certain toys. We hve a snap circuit kit and it doesn't power it enough to make the fans fly. A little disappointed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The batteries are the very worst I have ever used. I use a wireless mouse for work, and I've had to replace the battery every 2 weeks, instead of once a year like my old batteries. By the time you figure out how bad they are, you will be outside your return window. A fail for Amazon if you ask me, and makes me question whether I should keep shopping with them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The batteries had very short life. Long time fan of Amazon.com, first time buyer of Amazon brand batteries. Replaced batteries in a digital clock. After about 3 months (I bought the batteries in August, and now it's November), the batteries were dead. I have had this clock for years and never had any brand of batteries that lasted so short."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries worked perfect for my traxxas rustler rc remote
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good. They work - they seem to last a decent amount of time and the price is right.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries work just fine. We use them in our remotes and game controllers. Their life seems on par with big name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries work well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I opened up this package fresh and put two AA batteries in my Xbox one controller. It only lasted for a few hours of gameplay. When I took the batteries out they seem quite warm. I used my heat gun and they were 115F. I got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller. They only kept the controller on for less than a minute. When I took the batteries out one burned my finger. I grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over 127I'm not going to try and use anymore in any electronics. I'm not sure what's going on here Amazon.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"ALWAYS buy my batteries from Amazon Basics. GREAT price, delivered fast and with everything I need them for now a days, it is essential to have a stash around!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The best batteries you can get for the price, i have been using it in my xbox controllers so far i am satisfied with the results.Update: my controller batteries just died after like one month of use, i was rarely using my controllers(playing games). So, don't expect longer life from thess batteries. Still i am sticking with my 5 star for the price i paid."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Awesome value at an awesome price. I LOVE how 4 batteries are shrink wrapped at a time. This makes it so much easier to put in my car, flight bag, backpack, and any other place for the what-if moment. I'll be ordering the aaa pack soon..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The best deal on AA batteries you can find! They work great, and I'll definitely be buying more once I go through this large amount!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Really love these batteries. As everyone will tell you, this is the best deal on batteries you will find anywhere. Unlike other store brand batteries, these are actually good batteries that work, and yet they cost a fraction of what Duracell and Energizer batteries cost. I don't think I'll buy any other kind of battery again Amazon batteries from now on!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Long lasting, and a great price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn't work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn't work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Not a single one was a failure and not a single one leaked. Overall a good product.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,The charge is really bad. I used them all up super quick because they don't last. Will not buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works and performs just as long as other name brands. Great price for the number of batteries int he pack. Would recommend.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,solid AAA batteries that last na expected ammount of time. packaging easy and this is a seriously convenient option. Will always use this now as the price point and convenience make any other batteries a less economical choice.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The good quality I expect from Amazon.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've had great luck with these. Some brands don't take a charge, at ALL with my fairly sophisticated digital charger. SO many brands show up as fault. These don't."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The lights seem to work real well. I have not used them for long put they are plenty bright enough for the closet I'm using them in.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The main thing is - they work. Reliable batteries are great- and that's what these are, they just keep going and going and going, etc. :-)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Never again will my Fallout 4 excursions be interrupted by cheap gas store batteries, nothing but cats and raider smashing from here on out, thanks Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The latest reviews of name brand batteries have gone downhill lately. It seems they leak, rust, don't last, etc.. Perhaps Amazon is licensing older battery technology, or their manufacturer is anyway. So what These work better than the name brands! These are the only batteries I will buy, except Lithium Smoke Detector batteries. Amazon Any plans for Lithium batteries"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The only batteries that I buy now! Price is great and they seem to hold up as good as their more expensive competition.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What a deal!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Always a good value and packaging makes them easy to store and easy to use
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,One of the batteries was dead right out of the package. The other three in the pack was fine.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,The package was open and had no batteries....
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great product and just as good as others on the market. The packaging the batteries arrived in was very large and amazon could do better.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The performance on these batteries are pretty good- happy to be able to buy some cheaply and in bulk as we go through many AA batteries with all the toys for my two year old.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price for a commodity product
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,The price is good but they 'battery life' is much lower than other alkaline batteries we use. I get approx half the life from these batteries - compared to Walmart RayoVacs
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries last a while and for the amount of batteries you're getting, the price is great!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price!! Love the Amazon Basics line. No problems with quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"The price was good, but we had some trouble with them working in a flashlight. They didn't connect right, and we couldn't get it to work. The flashlight worked with other batteries, though."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They put out power. The price was good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,The price was great for these batteries but they don't last for very long. For some items they don't work at all. It's like they just don't have a lot of power. I will not be getting these again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,A++++ Seller. The Product was excellent and exactly what i needed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The quality of Amazon AA battery is going down. Now just after a few weeks, even when it shows full power from battery power meter, the Amazon battery cannot be used in many appliances. (bluetooth keyboard, soap dispenser...)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Those of us in World War II can all appreciate what was happening in the South Pacific while we were elseware. I was in the North Pacific at a secret U.S.-Russian site where we were planning a joint attack of Japan. We hear nothing about what was happening farther South. The book ansered our questions.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I was excited about the prices of these batteries, however you get what you pay for. These batteries are awful. I've used them in toys, remotes, and flashlights. The remote lasted for like a week! I used the flashlight for a few minutes and that's all the use I got out of them. I unsubscribed to this item. No thanks."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The package provided good quality batteries in a size I need most often, without including other sizes of less usefulness. I also appreciated the packaging, which is more accessible than the common drugstore packages (which can be a challenge to open)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, the seem like very good batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Appear to perform as well as top-brand batteries at a fraction of the price. The storage box they come in fits nicely in our utility drawer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I ordered the 100 pack of AAA AmazonBasics batteries for Christmas, dividing between my kids for the grandkids needs. The value versus the largest pack of ANY brand available at most retailers is great. The reviews I read prior to purchasing were good, and so far, we are very pleased"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The worst batteries that i have ever purchased. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Dont hold a charge for long and you have to buy Amazon's rechargeable pack. Doesnt work with otber brands but doesnt work with amazons either. I got this huge box and about 6 (yes, 6) actually recharge. Spend the money on duracell or energizer. I have a 4 pack of durcell with a charger and still works after years of recharging"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Worst batteries I have ever purchased - bought them for Christmas items like battery operated lights and candles but they didn't last even a week with limited usage. Spend a little more and get more for your and time, it'll save you in the long run!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"There was a deal somewhere where I could get 48 AA batteries, I wish I could get that deal for these batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"and then there's cheap. yeah cheap batteries alright but also cheap performance. these last half the time the C's house brand batteries, (in the same unit) for only just a little less money. disappointed as I was hoping Amazon might try to only put their name brand on half way decent stuff.there's a reason they send you a whole big box of 'em, ..... you'll go through 'em fast."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These alkaline batteries appear to be of good quality and provide excellent power output to my devices. Only time will tell if they provide long life in storage without leaiagel
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries! These Amazon Basics AAAs actually have surprisingly good battery life. I hate that devices that use AAAs still exist, but I'm glad I can get a bunch of them from Amazon on the cheap."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are a great price compared to buying brand name batteries at the store. I will definitely have enough AAA batteries to last a lifetime now haha. They have been working well since I got them, and I'll try to give an update on when they start to run out of power. My only complaint is that I wish they didn't package the batteries in the plastic film. I feel like the box was sturdy compact enough as is without the need for extra trash waste."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are a great price. I'm not sure they last as long as a name brand battery, but they get the job done."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I bought these thinking, Great I can save some money!...... Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pics.(like energizer)...... Seriously, these batteries last me probably 2 hours when using them a lot...... Not kidding.....I will not repurchase these......."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"For the money, these are an excellent buy and work very well."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are at the same price as generic cheap batteries, if not less expensive, and they last just as long as quality Duracell or Energizer, if not longer. I've stocked up on every type of battery with Amazon Basics."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These pants have become my everything in the cold pants. I bike, I run and I ski in them. I stay warm, I stay dry and the best thing of all I can move with no restrictions. I'm ordering another pair."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I will never buy expensive overpriced name brand batteries again. THESE ARE AWESOME.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are batteries, they came packed together. I put them in remotes when the old batteries die and these make the remotes work again. 5 stars."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I am a member of a wilderness search and rescue team and always need to keep backup batteries for flash lights, gps, and headlamps. These batteries are a great price and get the job done. They come sealed together which make them easy to toss into a back and ensure I have them when needed and aren't rolling around. I will be buying more in the future."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are batteries. They power battery-operated electronics. The end.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I literally can't think of anything else you would say about batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,But these every time
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are cheap and seem to last as long as any other battery I've tried. I'm seriously impressed with the amount of batteries I get. For the same price I could get 16 of my usual brand. This will be my go-to from now on.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Well I no longer need to ask if we have any batteries or move them from one device to another. These are cheap and they work as good as the name brands. I am very happy and everything in my home has a fresh battery. These are a great alternative to the normal Buy 4 for 20 packages in your local drug store. I wont buy another of those over priced packages again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are decent but I find they last about 20 less than Duracell batteries, but considering the cost difference they are actually worth it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are fine, for the price but not as Duracell"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"these are good batteries at a good price. with small kids in the house and approximately 9000 toys and remotes that need batteries, we use them often."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are good batteries, but they don't seem to last as many charges as some other brands I have used. They start to last a shorter time between charges. They were much less expensive than the other batteries so it probably all evens out."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Best place to buy batteries for a great price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are great batteries at a great price. Plain and simple. Don't be a dummy. Just buy them because you know you need a case of extra batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are great batteries for around the house and I don't notice any runtime difference between them and the other major brands. The price is awesome, and they work as expected. Nothing else to say about AA's really :)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are great batteries to keep on hand around the house. There's nothing really fancy about them. They're basic, they work, and the mulit-packs are very affordable (much more so than the ones I usually buy). They seem to work just as effectively, but they were less expensive AND saved me a trip to the store. It's a win-win!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are great batteries without paying the premium for name brands. Our kids go through batteries like their potato chips, so its nice to get a good product at a reasonable price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are great batteries, at a great deal. They last a long time and we are very happy with the purchase. We did however have some that are DOA, I called Amazon and they took care of us, AWESOME customer service, as always."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are great batteries. I'm not seeing any difference between these and the Duracell Pro Cell that are my standard choice. Good Value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are great for the price! They do tend to die slightly faster than other batteries, but overall they are great for what you pay. I would recommend these to anyone looking for basic batteries. The come in a plastic wrap which is easy to open. The same can't be said about some battery brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Why pay out your nose for Duracell These are great!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,a no brainer. these are great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are great. We go through AA batts like crazy in our house. Lasted just as long as the name brands but cost less. I will be purchasing again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are very long lasting and well-priced! I have been using them on voice recorders and noise cancelling headphones, and compared to other Alcaline and Ni-MH batteries, these are holding up pretty well!They also come with a cool packaging!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are just AA batteries and I really can't get excited about them. But here's the reason I'm giving them 5 stars. I had typically been buying Kirkland brand AA batteries at Costco. The Kirkland batteries come loose in this large cardboard packaging with a plastic tray thing to hold the batteries. The packaging of these batteries, wrapped in 4 packs in a little cardboard container, is so much nicer for storage than the Kirkland batteries. The packaging alone compared to what I've been dealing with makes this a 5 star product in my mind."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are just as good as the other name brands out there. I have been using them for awhile and so far none of my electronics need new batteries yet. Especially my wii controllers. Thank you Amazon! I am tired of wasting a lot of money on batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Now I have many batteries. No need to press Charges, officer. They know not, WATT they do.Is good batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"This battery is fine, but I purchased it because I thought it was rechargeable. Shame on me for not noticing, but I thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones I had purchased before. I bought it on Prime Day for about 6, so I thought I was just getting a great deal.Disappointing. I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,work but short life
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These are OK for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Costco Kirkland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Arrived on time, battery doesn't last very long though even when fully charged, so that's my only concern."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are perfectly good batteries that are affordable. I love having them on hand in bulk for those random times when I need a battery and do not want to go to the store.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are really good batteries. We have gotten these a few times now and haven't had any issues with them at all. They work well in everything we have tried them in. They seem to hold up just as long as other brands of batteries do. These are a good buy. would definitely recommend these batteries to other people.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are so a good value! I use these all around the house and they last a long time. I will never buy batteries at a regular store again!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are solid batteries and last as long as the name brands. These are the only batteries I buy now.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are batteries. They are afforadable and work like batteries should. Buy these batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far I love it very good price and all the batteries are fully charged :) (I checked!) I also love the package that it was in. I'm using it as storage for these batteries right now very useful. I guess all I'm saying everything that comes with this are useful :)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are the best bargin high performance batteries that I have found. At this price, why purchase name brand disposable batteries"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are the only batteries I use. The price is right and they work for a long time in the devices we use them in. I will keep buying them when I run out of batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Bought these batteries because of the 4 - 5 star ratings from verified purchases.....what These are the worst batteries I've ever used! 1 week of these batteries 1 month or more of brand name batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are batteries. They hold a charge and give that charge without malice and unconditionally. Unlike my ex wife.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are very good batteries at a good price. That aside, I contacted Amazon about my last set purchased, having seven batteries missing and the customer service promptly sent me a set to replace them quite quickly.It's impossible to have things go perfectly every time, and a lot can be realized by how a company handles things when problems surface. This couldn't have been handled any better."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are a great bargain. I use trail cameras to monitor my property, and they chew up AA batteries 8 at a time. These seem to last as long as any major brand I have used in the past, but at a fraction of the cost."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are a great buy, pretty much can't be beat for the price to quality ratio. I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are a great price and they hold up every bit as well as the more expensive varieties I,'ve bought in the past."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are a great value. They're very dependable. I have purchased several different brands of batteries and I would say these are by far my favorite for several reasons. Of course the price is 1, dependability is 2 and I can get them in two days with Amazon Prime. I would recommend them over any other brand I have used."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are alot better than i thought they would be. I bought them thinking they would burn out quick, WRONG!!!!!! They have lasted longer than the batteries i was using before i bought these. I use them quite a bit in xbox controller and my kids remote control cars. Very good batteries and good quality for the price. I was very suprised!!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are AMAZing. Honestly though, they last super long, and work just like a duracell. I have used the Amazon batteries for a few years, and I have been fully converted to using their brand on all my devices that use regular batteries. You will not be let down by the longevity and quality of these batteries. Plus, this is an incredibly good deal."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are better than name brand. When used in a device that has consistent, and equal, daily use, these batteries lasted 2 days longer than the bunny and the copper top."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are cheap and last fairly long. We go through so many in our house with all the toys!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I keep a good stock of batteries in my house. We have lots of flashlights and toys that require them. These are nicely affordable and I compare them to Energizer batteries, easily. (Don't look at 2nd pic if you're OCD )"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries are good, last long, but are temperamental. My electric trash can opens on a motion sensor. It worked great with the batteries for about a month, but then the trash can couldn't draw enough power in order to raise the lid. Then another week rolls by and the trash can works fine. I don't know if its the batteries or the trash can, but Im assuming its the batteries. Other than that, they work fine in everything else."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These batteries are great and last very long I would definitely recommend them to a friend or family over the Duracell brand better pricing
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are great, I used Duracell before for my remotes etc, but i am impressed with these, I am getting much longer life from them. I am updating this review, this will be the only battery I use, they last a long time, and are a good price!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are great. They last a long time just like the more expensive ones. I use a lot of batteries so this was just what I needed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are great. They last forever and are much cheaper than the name brands. Will continue to buy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are great. We love to have extra batteries especially around the holidays when it seems like every toy needs them. You can't beat the price and I think that these are just as great as the big brand names or at least I have not noticed a difference. We use them in everything from toys, to the TV remote, to flashlights etc. They come in a nice little cardboard box which is great to keep them all together for storage. Having loose batteries rolling around the junk drawer is never fun and they seem to get lost that way. I will buy these again for sure they are totally worth it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very trustworthy and reliable performance. Only batteries I will buy for their excellent endurance and great price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These batteries are not very good. I bought them for the electric candles and after they were used 2 for 4 hours, the batteries were dead. My candles with everready are still burning after months."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These batteries are okay they don't seem to last as long as brand name batteries, but you can't beat the price for these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The batteries suck. I have them in my mouse and I have to replace them every week. My Duracell's would last a month. I feel like they are only 1/2 charged, I put new ones in my flash for my high quality camera, and the flash was really slow and dim. Pretty crappy for new batteries. I am not pleased"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries are terrible. All of my clocks (bought in this same order) need new batteries already because they are all dying. I now have to buy all Energizer batteries. :-(
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I decided I would try to see how long Amazons batteries would last. Well, I placed a AA battery into an LED candle 14 weeks ago and have not turned it off and it is still running. It seemed before I was replacing batteries left and right. These batteries are the BEST and I have told all my neighbors as well. I will NEVER trust any of my electronics, etc to any other batteries except AMAZON.Chatty0371 Port Orange FL"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,There is no place to contact seller THESE batteries are the worst ! The last two days to a week. I would like a refund!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries are the worst. They leak and they die ridiculously fast. I've replaced the battery in my kitchen clock twice in the past month. They last about 6 hours of use in a Wii remote. I usually like the amazon basics brand, but these batteries were a total waste."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are used for gaming and last exceptionally long. During heavy gaming use with three people playing games daily, it's not uncommon for us to get 6 months out of this pack."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are as good as brand batteries. Actually better. Last a lot longer than brand, great purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries come very low charged. I took new batteries and put them in a computer mouse. Next day there was a Mouse Battery is very Low. Its not the first time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries contain electrons and the electrons make stuff work. I don't know how, exactly, because I have a liberal arts degree, but, even though I don't know how they work, they still do."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These batteries do not last long.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries do what batteries need to do. I'm writing a review b/c this was an Alexa deal, which she told me was 5, and was charged 8."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I bought these for my cameras. They don't last any time at all. I won't buy these again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These batteries don't last very long at all. Save your money. I don't recommend
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These batteries have a short life compared to other alkaline batteries that we use. They are definitely basic batteries. I will not order these again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries were great quality and have worked as well or better than other batteries we have purchased.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries have been working great for us so far. Excellent for all of todays modern Christmas and Birthday Presents.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I use AmazonBasics batteries all the time, both the AA and AAA. I like them a lot and they last as long as any other batteries. I change the smoke detector twice a year to be safe but batteries in my clocks last a year before needing replacement. I'll continue using AmazonBasics because in addition to working they are a little more cost effective. Another great job Amazon.com!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries have worked well for us. We used rechargeable before this and they never worked as well as these. I would purchase again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries las forever and are at a great price compared to others. I use them in everything and never had a problem.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries last about 25 of a stander energizer! Dont be suckered in by the price..... WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries have been performing wonderfully in my clocks and other small appliances. The price is right with Subscribe and Save and I can't beat the quality or price elsewhere. They come nicely packed and shrink wrapped in four packs making them easy to carry. I will definitely continue to purchase.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries last long and work great. I love buying in large quantities so when I am in need of replacing batteries in any of my electronics I don't have to worry about not having any.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These Batteries last longer than other leading brands. Will always order these from now.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Please be aware that these batteries leak! I put these in a few electric candles and alarm clocks in our house, after a few days the bottom of the candles and clocks were coated with battery acid. No other battery brands have done this in our house before. I cannot tell you if they last long or not, got rid of them immediately."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great price, and shipped safely and Amazon was efficient with the packaging. I bought this pack to replace a 100 pack of Maxell cheap-o batteries that I bought on Amazon years ago. I finally ran out, and decided to try the Performance Alkaline Batteries from AmazonBasics. Quality so far seems to be good. They have been holding their charge well for the devices I'm using them on. These are primarily being used for wireless keyboards and mice, but the area that I've been able to gauge their performance is in a couple of battery operated LED light strings that I use in my studio. With the old batteries, I noticed that I would get about 48 hours of usage before the lights would start to dim. These batteries have been giving me close to double the life. For the price, quite impressed.It's hard to get too fancy on a review for AA batteries, but these happen to work quite well."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries provide power at a cheaper cost than most. Use these mainly for my Xbox controller because it eats batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries seem to be really good they hold up just as long as nine brand we use them in our two way radios and our headlamps
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries seem to work great and last plenty long enough for my use cases (remotes, computer mouse, flashlights, etc.)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries were a great purchase and I am very happy to have found the amazon brand in something that I use so frequently. I thought the price was fantastic for a package of twenty batteries. I use AAA batteries for a lot of things around my house so I like to order a substantial supply of them when I get new batteries. I couldn't have been more pleased when I discovered that Amazon has their own brand of batteries. I have never been disappointed with anything to do with Amazon and I am absolutely sure these batteries will meet all my expectations. When I received them I immediately put them into a clock that needed them. I also put them into my milk frother and a few other devices. The clock is keeping perfect time and the other devices are working at full capacity. These will be used in my remote controls and any other thing that requires this size battery. I will be ordering them in other sizes too. This is the perfect situation. I have found a great resource to purchase my batteries and have them in two days delivered straight to my door. These are a great buy and I recommend them to anyone needing batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work better than the high dollar kind. I love them and will never buy another brand. They last a long time and have no trouble powering a battery draining device.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work great! I didn't have any problem using them in my battery powered candles this Christmas season. They lasted a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These batteries work great. I would say comparable to top brands. We've used some for approximately one month and they are still going strong.We are currently using them in our game controllers and a clock...Will update as needed
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries seem to last as long an Energizer. If you are a big battery user, these batteries work just fine for less."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries work just fine. I don't see a need for writing some big long review about batteries. All we care about is do they work, are they strong Absolutely and I will buy them again"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These battery arrive in a nice packaging. Super easy to open and store. The battery itself is great! definitely would purchase again!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These came with touch lights and they have been used for 7 days. The lights are already so dimmed and the batteries need replacing soon.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"...not even in a mouse, where I've already had to replace the batteries in less than three months, where premium brand batteries last the best part of a year or more.I thought these would be a bargain given the price. But the life is so short there is no benefit or savings. I won't buy these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These don't seem to last very long at all. I used them on my light in chicken coop. I replace once a week and only used it 2 or three times each week. Very dissapointed in this purchase. I usually buy our batteries from Costco.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These have been the worse batteries. I've bought these before and didn't have a problem but this batch doesn't even last a month.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These have worked great in all of our flashlights, remotes, and all my kid's game controllers and toys. They last just as long if not longer than the much more expensive name brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I used to by the cheap chinese batteries from HF. Now that I've discovered AmazonBasics I'm now converted. These last much longer and are the best bang for your buck. I will certainly buy more when these run out!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person in LED lights which don't pull a lot of power. I will go for a brand name next time...I can't have my students getting burns from leaky batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I've used! I should send back..
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These seem to be normal AAA batteries. can't comment yet on life expectancy but for the price they could stand to be near the bottom performance and still be an okay value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These seem to work just as good as any other AA battery but for SO MUCH CHEAPER. Seems like every battery operated device in our house takes AAs. I buy these as well as the Amazon rechargeable ones and they all work great. No regrets with this purchase.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We use a lot of AA batteries with a number of wireless devices. For years, we have been I guess habitually dependent on Rayovac Alkaline AA Batteries 36-Pack. They have been as good as any other batteries we used and the price was unequalled, that is, until we began to look on Amazon.com. We then decided to try others, until we got a box of Duracell Procell AA 144 Batteries PC1500. They seemed to consistently last longer than the others. They were also usually 6 cents cheaper per battery. Undoubtedly, this was spelling: B-A-R-G-A-I-N! Actually, we remained with these, not even looking at alternatives until we kind of tripped over these AmazonBasics. Hands-down, these have been our best battery purchases. They are good, and originally were the cheapest yet! We don't even look for other bargains. I don't think it's worth the time or effort."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These were at a great price point didn't last anywhere near as long as I thought they would. For the little bit more I would get the Duracell or Enegizer ones.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"For the many devices that use batteries in our house, these were great, low-priced option. Will incrementally switch high-use devices to rechargeables for even greater savings."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These were so cheap, but they work just as well as name brand batteries. Come in a cardboard box which is so much easier for storage than those cardboard and plastic things"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work as well or better as Duracell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries seem to perform as well as the name brands, and they cost less. In addition, they come in a nice box instead of being encased is plastic bubbles which take up a lot more room and make accessing the batteries much more difficult."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"We normally like to use rechargeable batteries but we have a few items that say not to use them so we bought these to use in those items. These batteries seem to work well so far everything is going well with them. They seem to be lasting okay, we did have a couple that seemed to run down quickly, we are chalking that up to the fact that my son left the device they were in on for an extended amount of time.We will continue to use the rest of the batteries and see how the rest of them perform. I will post an update if we find we have anymore that rundown quickly."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are exactly what you would expect. I have not had any issues with them not lasting long. I would recommend these to anyone looking to purchase batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Wow....the big A even has branded batteries at a discount compared to the copper tops. These work great, bought some double A's a while back which were great too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I think my kids eat these or share them with friends because I fly through them. These work great, sure they aren't a top lithium brand or something but for most applications this is exactly what you need and in a quantity that works and ensures you have them on hand when you need them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work just as well as namebrand alkaline batteries. I will buy them again
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These work pretty well, we used them for long term use in our Christmas candles for the whole month of December and they lasted the whole month."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work really well and came in a very nice cardboard package. The organization of the cardboard package was much nicer than many of the plastic and cardboard packages batteries come in from the store. It was much easier to keep them all in the box (similar to a colored pencil box) than to try to shove them back in a half falling apart plastic package. They seem to work just as well as any storebrand batteries. I would definitely recommend these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"While these surely don't last as long as big brand batteries, they are a good substitute when your kids have 5000 toys that required 3-8 batteries a piece! They do the job and power those things up just as any other battery brand would."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They are batteries and at a good price, what else can I say"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"For the first time, a product that had packaging that was designed for the product and the product made it to me in one piece. as for the batteries, well, they are batteries and power my items just fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,they are batteries and they make my battery powered stuff work so im not sure how this could get a low rating. for the price well worth it. that said they don't seem to last quite as long as other name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Charged batteries at a low price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are batteries. Appear to be similar to the name brand batteries. Do not know if equal in performance or not and really don't care as the price is very inexpensive.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They are batteries. They are cheap. They work. That is all, goodnight."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are batteries. They work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,they are cheep so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kids toys and they don't last long.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries last as long if not longer than other top name brands. This is the only way I buy batteries now. They are conveniently delivered to my door at an excellent price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These have been a much improved highly accepted battery replacement for the last order of Orange boxed Pro-Cells we received.Duracells were so short lived, it was necessary to get them out of service due to unstable charge, and even seals leaking and ruining devices.Amazon Basics items have been a way to save money consistently, and get quality that some manufacturers are skimping on.These have been no exception.They are dated: 2026, and I have no doubt they are a great buy.As of now these are powering many devices, and none have shown any questionable service."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"They are good batteries for the price but I find I have to change the batteries in my kid's toys more often than I did with duracell. Because of the price I would still buy them again, but if it's something you don't want to be swapping the batteries on all the time, I would go for a different battery."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,For the price and the quantity you can't beat these. They are great batteries too. Last a long time
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work well so far no complaints. They are great little batteries and would buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Has power of Energizer Max, price of Amazon basic. Great for all the kids toys and remotes."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are just what i was expecting My vote is more items should be designed for AA use.. Most AAA connection posts on wireless mice are insufficent for long term use. You guys know what I mean. You dont have to monkey around with a AA mouse.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"They are OK but not nearly as good as other batteries. They die far more quickly than other name brands. For example, I've changed the battery on my mouse three four times in just a few months already verses prior Durecell batteries that I changed maybe once a year. Several other things such as wireless Apple keyboard, remotes, etc., similar results, e.g., batteries wore out in a third or fourth of the time of Durecell. I won't buy them again. Discount not worth it. Result of purchase has been net negative."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They are okay. I thought by the reviews they would last longer but I'm only getting a little life out of them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Yup, batteries cheap. They are packaged like a PITA though and you ahve to rip these outa shrink wrap. Good for commercial resale in a store, since they are then packaged into smaller units for resale, for home use when you what to just dump them into a box and be done for the kids to grab like Halloween candy for all their gear - not easy to do that with. But to of batteries its still a good deal.. just expect some work opening them all up to dump them out."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"but I am not convinced that they last as long as Energizers. But, still, the price makes them well worth it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Have batteries for a long time...they are pretty good...using them with cat coin box..nice...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"There isn't much I can say about these batteries. They are stand AA batteries that offer amazing performance at an amazing price! At 0.34 (normally 0.43) cents a battery, not only are they comparable to 1 batteries (Usually 0.25-0.50 cents a battery), but they are much more heavyweight and they last a lot longer! Between the 4 of us, especially our 2 kids, we fly through batteries like water and when we find a discount brand we like, we hold on to them tightly! I will be purchasing more AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries especially with the Holidays coming. They are inexpensive, high quality and worth every penny!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great for the price, the have lasted as long as name brands. I will purchase more in the future."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They arrived on time, as described, and have been powering the PIR lights I ordered for a few weeks now with out needing to be changed. I have no reason to complain."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They came super quickly in the mail, they were very inexpensive compared to Duracell or energizer i would have bought at target and they are long lasting and work great!!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They certainly do the job. They might not last quite as long as the name brands, but for the price difference, I think it all works out in the long run. They work for my needs."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Their regular batteries, what else can I say about 'em."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Not only are these the least expensive AA batteries I could find, they come shrink-wrapped in little 4-packs so it's obvious no matter what which ones are brand new and you can scatter them about the house like the battery fairy so there's always a fresh pack nearby."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These suck! I may as well bought dollar tree batteries! We put them in three wreaths for Christmas lights that turn on for 4 hrs at night then turn themselves off with a timer and they burned out in three days, that's 12 HRS! Don't recommend...."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I thought I was getting a deal when I saw these batteries. Unfortunately, they died after two weeks. I do not recommend buying this brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Worst performance in AA alkaline batteries we have ever seen. We bought these for use in our manufacturing company, and we used them in a wide variety of applications. Everyone has had poor performance. For clocks that used to have batteries last three years, this brand lasted only several weeks. Same problems when used in a computer mouse by several people, laser pointers, and other applications. We are going back to name-brand AA batteries. This is the worst rating I have given any product in a long time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,they do not last like other batteries. i use in candles with timers... i get maybe 2 weeks out of them... 50+ hours.... i use to get months out of my duracell....
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These do not last long. I will stick to Kirkland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The fact that I have Amazon prime receive my orders in 2 days plays a major part in my decision to purchase these batteries. Which I prefer to order them instead of driving 30 min. to the store and waiting in line to pay. They work okay. I used them in a digital camera and they lasted a good 8 hrs of use. Of course I powered off my camera when not in use. But they lasted about the same timeframe as Duracell in my opinion. I have also used them in television remotes and I have had the same batteries in there for about a month now and they still work great. So overall, in my opinion, these batteries are a good purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I find myself wishing these had more capacity, but I'm also using these exclusively for a camera flash, so the nature of the beast is: high drain, changing out batteries often. They do the job, but don't expect energizer lifespan out of these guys."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'm always satisfied with these batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great, long lasting batteries. I got them for my game camera, and after two months of use, they're still going strong on the first set."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"They don't last. USed in electronics (like computer mice, computer keyboards) Energizer or Duracell last easily 3x longer. Not worth the savings. If its going in some kids game or infrequent use (where the battery would be dead later anyways) ok."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,They don't seem to last that long as the ones you can get off the store. I bought them because I thought they were cheaper but Sam's club sells them cheaper and they last much longer.Update 1/10/2017Not only do they not last long but the new batteries that say are good till 11/2018 are pretty much dead without any use.Highly disappointed in amazon for this.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,It's a great price but the batteries do not last long at all!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"The tips seem to be polished so much that they do not make good contact. I had a problem where these batteries wouldn't work at all, but the duracell ones that I took out would. After swapping back and forth a few times, I took them to my battery tester and found that I had to twist them around to get them to register. So I took my batteries to some sand paper to get the contact point to work."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They don't really last that long.. I had them in my mouse I blew through them really quickly. I wouldn't buy them again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I've used Amazon batteries for many years and have never had a leaker. I can't say that about US made batteries...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"They don't seem to work except in very low energy items. Can't get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Mine don't appear to have a charge. I bought them for a plant watering system that takes AAA batteries. I tried three sets of these AAA batteries in the plant watering system, which works fine currently with rechargeable batteries. They alkaline performance batteries don't work.I was hoping to get longer battery life from these performance batteries but they don't work at all."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,They don't work. Still to regular brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Hey, they're batteries, have an expiration date, fit as expected. I assume they last just as much as the high dollar batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What can I say They work! )
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Bought these for a couple of baby toys, and so far, they have worked great. They are much cheaper compared to other popular brands!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought these last year and they're still working!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I tried these thinking they were much less expensive than the brand name batteries and they would likely last a similar amount of time. I was wrong. I primarily use these in remote controls. While I don't have specific test results, the Duracell batteries would last well over a year in my Dish Remote. I purchased these in February and have already replaced the batteries twice. Perhaps I ended up with a bad batch, but I won't be trying these again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"The longevity of these batteries is nothing special. They do not compare to Duracell or Energizer alkalines. After reading the reviews, I was greatly disappointed. I used them, among others, for a wall clock and remote controller. Their longevity is no better than alkaline batteries marketed and sold by Walgreen's for example. Take this into consideration before you buy them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What a great deal! They last as long as any other 'name brand' batteries!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They last as long as any others. Why pay more
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I only use Amazon basics batteries now. They last as long as name brands at a much better price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love these batteries. I keep them stocked in the cabinet. Two teenagers go through batteries lije there's no tomorrow. Glad I can save money with Amazon Basics. They last just as long as the name brand batteries. I keep the AAA and AA on hand at all times. Thanks Amazon...you make my life easier in so many ways!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheap batteries. They last like cheap batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries...
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,We tried these batteries out but they're trash. They lasted only 2-3 weeks in our tivo remotes which is amazing as we don't watch that much tv.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"bought these for remote control vehicle, they lasted pretty long, several hours , so they did the job"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,They lasted really little.. (some of them) I use all batteries for same led lamps and 2 out of 4 Drained the Battery Quickly.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries leak. What more is there to say They are the worst. Do not buy these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"DO NOT BUY THEM.I got them because it said they were anti leakage. Well guess what.they leaked!!, completely destroyed my keyboard and I cant even open it up to get the batteries out. A waste of money and will also cost me a whooping 100 for a new keyboard and I cant use my desktop until I get a new keyboard."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They do what I need batteries to do.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I put them in my electronic devices and they started working. I guess I'm pretty happy about that.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,AA Batteriers....they power stuff i want to use pretty good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They provide a good level of power and fit in battery compartments that are designed for AAA batteries. What more can you ask for.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They provide me with electricity. Let there be light. Seem to be lasting too so I have that going for me.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These are okay. I use them mostly in my Xbox controller, they runout pretty quick. They are fine but I am looking into getting a rechargeable battery pack for it because I hate having my controller die mid game."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They seem like a good value, thus far. If they last as long as expected, 5 stars may be in order."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They seem like quality batteries. I have used them in multiple devices and don't see any difference between them and name brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They seem to be lasting but only time with tell the quality of them. I wouldn't expect them to be bargain basement batteries. Probably somewhere between Rayovac and Duracell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I've only used four so far so can't give five stars yet. They seem to be working fine but I'm not going to test one to destruction so it will be a feel I get over time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Just a bunch of batteries, they seem to work well and have a good lifespan. I use them in my wireless 360 controllers. None of them were damaged when they shipped. I'm sure I'll buy these again when I run out, but that will probably take a while."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They seem to work well. I've only used three of the pack thus far, but that item is still going strong."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I buy these for my vibrator. They work just as well as the name brands but half the price. They definitely do as expected
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I see too many people complaining that they don't have as much charge as they want them to but really The price is great! They help a lot when you have a 3 year old who constantly gets new toys that need batteries. These are the only batteries I buy now. I love them.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're batteries and they come charged and ready to go, there is not much of a review you can write about batteries. They power my daughter's choo choo train set, so I'm content."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Between our toddler's toys and various household gadgetsremotes etc, we needed a lot of batteries! These battery value packs from Amazon are awesome! We've found that the Amazon basics batteries last almost as long as the big name brand ones do. They are a lot cheaper though and I don't see myself buying expensive name brand batteries anytime soon."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"This is my second time purchasing these Amazon AA batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great. I'm currently using them in LED lights for decoration and the first set I purchased would last burning 8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, however these new performance batteries noticeably dim after 3 or 4 days of burning."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,as advertised
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,good Batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,On par with most other name brands in length of time use
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfect and a good price. No more running to the hardware store for batteries. So much easier.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Put them in the grand kids toys and they worked.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,really they are batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Solid batteries. Never been disappointed by amazon batteries before
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries seem to work just as good as other leading brands and at a cheaper price point! I haven't had any leaks in anything I have used them in so far.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are pretty much your typical AAs for a very cheap price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,they work
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,they work - what more can I say LOL
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,What can I say about a battery
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,work great. Well packaged.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good qualifty...and price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Hey, they work and priced great. Nice to have plenty on hand for the million things that take double A. Nicely packaged in box, but then the plastic wrap around them is a bit much."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"bought these for wireless keyboards and mice, they work and seem to have a pretty long life."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"They work and they're cheap, but Duracell lasts longer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They're batteries. They work as they should. They should last 5 years: hopefully so.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work as well, if not better, than other more expensive batteries I've purchased in the past. They last as long. They seem to have the same power as in pocket flashlights shine as bright, and I can have them delivered right to my door for less than I'd pay at the store. Can't beat that. I will continue to buy these and the other size Amazon Basic Batteries"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"For some reason I thought I was buying rechargeable ones as these showed up in the results when I typed in rechargeable AAA batteries in the search box. Must not have paid too much attention, oh well. They work as well as the so called high end long lasting brands and I'm still glad that I have them, as it's nice to have extras on hand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No more going to the store for batteries for me. So far they have been working fine.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I was intending to buy rechargeables, but bought these by mistake. They work fine though."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works like any other brand and a whole lot cheaper.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They work fine. Not the longest lasting battery but dollar for dollar they do just fine
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work fine. Why would anyone buy half the quantity for more than 2X the price at some box store
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I dont know what I could possibly say that over 6,000 other reviewers have not already said.. so I won't even go into details. I needed more AAA batteries, and I am a amazon-junkie so I ordered their batteries. Popped three into a flashlight that needed batteries.. and I had light! They work.. Now how they will hold up over time, I do not know yet.. but they work for now and worked in my flashlight so I am happy with them!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works as well if not better than other batteries. Will order again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work good!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"See what I did with that title up there Anyways, my wife likes using AA batteries as if for each one we use and throw away a puppy is adopted from the local animal shelter. And since we've moved on from regular candles to LED ones in our home, we need more AAs than ever. Nowhere will you find a better price! My dad once told me that all batteries are made the same, its just the label that's different, just like antifreeze. I still don't know if that is true, but these batteries last just as long as anything else we've tried. Also, if you have something against batteries colored black or silver, you just hit the jackpot."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,AmazonBasics AAA rock
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, they work great and have lasted a few days in my trail cameras, and I like the price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Seem to be working very strong in my flashlights!!! They last almost as long as the expensive batteries that i have been using. and these r one third the cost!!! I am highly impressed with these, This is the only brand of batteries i will be buying from here on out!!! I have only tested the AA and the AAA so far."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They work great, have been lasting longer than the Dollar Tree ones I got for my mouse (which is what I primarily need them for)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They make my stuff work I love it when my stuff works. They seem to last as long if not longer than name brand batteries. I will never buy batteries at the grocery store again!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Nothing wrong with these batteries. They seem to work just as good as the named brand ones I buy at the store and they defiantly work better than the cheap-o ones. I am currently using some in a battery operated lanterns, a flash light, and one of my youngest daughters toy. I have not experienced any problems with these.I really like that I can order good quality batteries at a good price and have them delivered to my door. Honestly we could always use more batteries at our house."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries. Not a whole lot to say about them other than they work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work great.and the price is really great!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work great. Best value on batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can't beat the price. They work just as good as name brand. It's even cheaper in the subscribe memberships. Try them
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,they work just as I needed them to
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work GREAT and are much more affordable! This pack will last about 2 months but that's because nobody else buys batteries in my house. They all take mine which had become too expensive of a habit for me. They work just as well (if not better!) than the brand I used to buy. I'll be buying other sizes of these to have on hand, especially since they don't break my (limited) wallet!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries perform just as efficiently and effectively as their more expensive name brand counter parts.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They are batteries and they work. I don't think they last as long as some of the more expensive batteries but really its hard to tell.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've been using the Amazon Basics batteries for some time. I get them on subscribe and save.These are not meant to be heavy duty or super long life. They last reasonably long for my purposes and the price is extremely fair. These are so inexpensive that I don't expect them to last as long as the name brands and therefore I don't worry about it. I feel they do a very good job for the way I use them (mouse, keyboard, mini flashlight, small radio, etc.) and will continue to order the Amazon Basics in both the AA and the AAA sizes."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"There working good in my xbox one controller, have not done extreme test to see how long they last, (they last long enough) for the price I can already tell there a better buy than any name brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They work really well, they do not drain quickly so that is a plus since I need them for my xbox controller."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They work we... Maybe don't last as long as the high dollar batteries, but the price makes up for that."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work well enough. Probably don't have the longevity of a Duracell but for the price you're coming out on top.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Not bad. They do the job and so far so good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I can't really tell much of a difference in performance to give a detailed analysis, but that is a good thing, really. They work! They aren't garbage and they are a lot cheaper than name brand, so they are worth it. If I ever really tell a difference based on their performance on multiple devices, I'lll update, but for now, they seem to be just fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I don't know much about batteries, but these work....so I love them!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I've never actually paid attention to how long batteries last in anything. Still don't. These are working though!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No problems. They do exactly what I would expect.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries and they work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,works like they're supposed to. They're AAA Batteries after all. Either they work or they don't. Makes it convenient to order them online than having to remember if you grabbed them from the store.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work. I don't know how they compare...but I received these batteries very quickly.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work. :)None of them have exploded.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works like a charm.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're AA batteries. They seem to work in the kid's toys. Hope they are long lasting. No idea how they compare to Eveready, Kirkland, or Duracell."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,They're AAA batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're batteries, and cheap. So far they've worked great!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,they're batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. If they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and letchall know."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"AmazonBasics batteries are definitely the way to go. Or at least if you need AA or AAA batteries (the 9v batteries aren't that great). You get a higher quantity for less the price compared to going to Target. And for what it's worth, I really like the simplicity of the packaging."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Yup, they work."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries work just as well as any other, but cost less. The voltages are the same as any other one I tried- and in some devices I'm pretty sure (since I'm not a professor of Battery Science) they last longer than other brands."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price and the batteries work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They're batteries. They seem to last as long as big name brands for much less cost.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries. They work. They're incredibly cheap. What more do you want
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries....they do what batteries are suppose to do....
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Perfectly fine batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"As with my review of the other batteries I reviewed, they're batteries. They all work and provide approximately 1.5vdc as supposed to."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Came on time and in one piece. Haven't noticed a difference in quality between these batteries and any other name brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're good quality batteries for a really good price! You'd be stupid to pass this deal up!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I buy amazonbasics batteries in all the sizes that they make. they're great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top brands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top brands in the future. We go through a lot of the AA variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but..."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,CheapDon't last all that long
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This are so good I keep coming back for more. I've used other brands and the so called good fall behind in performance. The top of the line, are really good, but they put a dent in my pocket. I use this all around the house along with the AAA ones. To all give it a try before you judge them, maybe you end up with a smile and extra cash from the saving."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries can be so expensive when you are purchasing small quantities. This AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries 20-Pack was a great bargain that puts the batteries at 0.33 cents each or less. They work well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This batteries are the best. Cost is cheap but last like top brands. Have reordered these many times and in different sizes. I will never buy a different battery brand again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This is a good deal, and it's alot of batteries for the price. Ten year shelf life is great, even 4 or 5 years would be good, so if they last 10 that's even better."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,DO not buy this product I've received this product to replace batteries in remote-control candles all three candles did not work I was ready to discard the candles when I decided to try different batteries. As soon as I put the different batteries from another company the candles worked fine. Tried to find a place to write to the seller but couldn't so apparently I'm just stuck for the price of the batteries which are useless!!!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I would give it zero stars if possible. Every single battery came dead. Every. Single. One. Completely useless and a waste of time to try and fight for a refund. Usually I have great faith in AmazonBasics, but now I'm not so sure."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I waited to make sure they AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack)would hold up. Great value!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Very competitive product at good price. I originally rated this le, but learned I had. made a mistake in my install."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Great price for AA batteries. I needed a lot of them to maintain battery-powered Xmas window candles. These seem to be working fine. Easy-open cardboard package is very convenient.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I hoped that an Amazon-branded product would have decent quality, but these batteries are just terrible. Their charge will last for about 1/10 of the usual top brands. Very disappointed. I'm never buying an Amazon battery again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I was super bummed about these! I purchased them exactly 3 months ago today. I only used 8 batteries when they arrived, and they have all started to die this week already. When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! So to recap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even usable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"My Mother in Law owns a home decor store with a lot of battery operated things like clocks, etc. We ordered these for her and she spent hours putting them in things all around the store. Once they were on they only lasted about 30 minutes. She then had to go back and take them all out and go out and buy different batteries. Really disappointing and a huge hassle for her. Have never had batteries last such a short time. We were very unhappy."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Not sure why they won't recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"The batteries I got have very little charge left in them. 2 batteries only lasted 2 days in my Wii remote, whereas other batteries lasted weeks. V"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"All 20 of the batteries are dead (no power). Very disappointed to receive a product with Amazon's name on it that is useless, especially as a Prime member."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Many of these batteries are not working at all. Very disappointed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I have several Amazon basics products and always tell my friends how much I love them. after purchasing Amazon basics AA batteries and AAA size, I was very disappointed. every single battery lasts a day or two on a power toothbrush, an xbox wireless controller, a roku remote and other daily gadgets. I am extremely surprised, since I buy batterie brands like rite aid, acme, Walmart, etc."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Exactly what you would expect. Very good price and nicely packaged.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Hi folks... these are just good all around batteries. Used them for years.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, these batteries are very good. I like to have a large quantity on hand so I don't have to always be buying a battery. The price was real good and I have nothing negative to say."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Nice for the price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,These are great- I use these and the AAA and they've performed well for me. I'm giving 4 stars because I haven't formally tested them but I do order them regularly.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These worked very nicely-no complaints-I use a lot packaged very nice as well. I got good use out of this Amazon battery-try it!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They seem to last as good as Duracell procell
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon's doing most things well and have been for quite a while. These Amazon brand batteries are as good as the other copper top!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very pleased with these batteries as I ordered both these and triple A's and was amazed at the life of these batteries. will absolutely reorder as needed.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Cheap, good and Prime 2 day delivery. How can you go wrong"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"About 1/3 the price of anything in Wal-Mart. With 3 kids, we use a lot of batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Work fine, very good price, good batteries! Word to the wise check the good to date on the Batteries, if possible! Some places lower the prices when close or past good to date. Past a good chance or bad of leakage."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries work well and have a good life expectancy. Excellent product and great price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"The Amazon product line seems to have decent products. These batteries are no exception. There are many reviewers who will say these batteries are terrible, good, great, awesome, unsurpassed, etc. It seems the general consensus is these batteries are great for their intended purpose.First, I recommend you take a look at C (https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35H8Y36S43CSG/refcmcrdppdp) review. This is a highly credible review as he put in his time and effort to test the batteries out. With that said, here are my two cents on batteries I have previously bought on Amazon:Rayovac: Smart choice for your portable digital electronics, lasting just a little less long as other leading brands. They are perfect for powering low-drain devices like clocks, radios, remote controls and low-powered flashlights. If you're looking for an affordable and reliable battery, get these. But it only works for me on 3-5 uses using my eyelash curler. These are good and cheap batteries. I use them for simple things that don't require a lot of power, such as my computer mouse. They do not last long, but for the price I pay I don't expect them to. if I want a quick battery that isn't going to cost more than a couple dollars I usually go with these.Duracell:Despite the shorter use by date (3/2021) than my recently purchased Energizer Industrial AAA alkalines (12/2026), these ProCell (Duracell) alkaline AAA cells have the highest open circuit voltage I've ever measured. I admit to being a price shopper, opting for 48 for 15 (Prime) rather than 24 for 11. If I get results similar to the ProCell AA and D cells I recently purchased, the AAA's should be good performers. Sadly, they are a too-tight fit to use in my recent Surefire Titan (flashlight) one AAA cell LED flashlight - but that is on the Surefire. I received decent life on these batteries besides using them in a flashlight (remote control car, remote, smoke alarm (7 months) and others. Good batteries for the right price.Energizer:I have used these in my mouse for my computer, my Xbox 360 Remote and my cable box remote. Part of me feels like these didn't last as long as they could have, but my mouse never gets shut off and my Xbox gets used relatively often (I'm not a gamer, but I use the system to watch movies).I read other reviews where people say that one of the sellers is selling used batteries I didn't have that experience. Mine arrived in a package that didn't seem to have been tampered with prior to shipping.I just ordered some Duracell Procell batteries. I want to see if they'll last longer than these did and they did not.Energizer Lithium:I put these batteries into all of the electronic Z-wave door locks that I own, because the Duracell alkaline batteries that I had been using were dying very quickly (they'd only last a about 2 months, and rechargeable ones would only last 3-4 weeks). The locks are very low-drain because most of the time they are just sitting there, but when you unlock or lock it uses a large burst of energy. And that's exactly the type of device that lithium batteries are recommended to be used in. I installed these about 4 months ago and they're all still showing 100 charge in my system control panel! Granted it only moves in 25 levels so it could be anywhere from 76-100, but still even if it depleted at a rate of 25 every 4 months that means they'll be good for at least 1 year before being replaced. That's about 6x longer than alkaline batteries would last, or if they live up to the claim of 8x then I'll get 16 months out of them. Either way I'll be saving a lot of time and money not having to swap out batteries every few months, I can now put it on my yearly to-do list instead.I also use the 9V batteries in my smoke detectors, and according to the specs they should only need to be changed every 10 years instead of the 2 years that I was getting with alkalines. Sure they are 5-7x more expensive (depending if you buy in bulk or not), but I'll gladly pay that price to not have to get up on a ladder in the middle of the night to swap out beeping smoke detector batteries all the time.Amazon Basics Batteries:The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand like you would get with the Energizer lithium. For the most part, they will perform like all the major brand with the exception of Rayovac. I find these last longer than then. As for regular Energizer and Duracell, I feel the difference is negligible. Some may or may not last longer than the Amazon brand while the others WILL last longer. I suppose it depends on the application they are used for.So in turn, yes I would recommend these to the typical consumer. The price is cheaper, the quality should be comparable to the rest. I would give them a try. If they are crappy then youre out a couple of bucks. Probably the same price when you decided to order the liver and onions you didnt like at so and so :P"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very good price this this many AA batteries. I'm very pleased at this buy. Now we'll just see how long they last!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This many batteries at this price How is that even possible Amazon is really competing against other product's prices with their amazon basics line. I bought these a while ago and will be buying again. Batteries in my household go by quick. This pack of 48 is great for my needs and the batteries themselves pretty good themeslves. I'll admit that Duracell are better in terms of performance and durability but they can be expensive sometimes. I feel like energizer are also a step above these but for the price, you can't go wrong. They do last long (depending on use) and seem like a better option compared to the cheap batteries found at gas stations of dollar stores. Great purchase overall."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Really good working.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very good deal and quality!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very good product.I find they work better than some name brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,All are working as they should. Very good purchase.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Good quality batteries at a reasonable price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very good value and price! I could get batteries at the store for maybe 10pk or 20pk for 16.99-32.99 I rather buy all my batteries here!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've ordered these before and was very pleased. I've just recieved my second set and the quality has held steady. My 5 kids are hardcore gamers and we go through batteries faster than toilet paper, it seems. These are solid performance batteries at an excellent price. I used to buy my batteries in bulk at Costco, but they've raised their prices significantly, so I was thrilled to find these on Amazon for MUCH less. Highly recommended."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell. They come close, I think, but definitely not as long. I use AA batteries primarily in my iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, for what it's worth. Still, these amazon batteries are significantly cheaper, so it all probably evens out."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries. Amazon brand is excellent.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,No issues. Batteries have lasted longer than other store name brands. Very happy.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"these batteries last a long time, very happy to have found them on such a great deal"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great products, great quality and a really good quantity . Thank you , I'm very happy with my purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I just received these and immediately tested all 24 with my trusty digital multi-meter....22 tested excellent to better than normal, and two tested right in the normal to little less than normalto what any commercial brand battery tests...therefore, I'm very happy with this shipment, but I'll review the life-span in the field with daily use in our irrigation drip system-timers and post that when I have results. thanks Amazon!...I will buy these again!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon will become my battery supplier in the future. Very happy with the purchase.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Ok, I'm hooked on these batteries! With 4 kids in my house, we go through a lot of batteries. I'm constantly buying them and they are very expensive. Amazon batteries are so cheap and they have lasted just as long as Duracell and energizers. I am very impressed and will keep ordering these over any other brand. Very happy with these batteries!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very happy with this purchase and I am hard to please! Thank you !
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Barring that, enjoy!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are every bit as good as the big name brands for a fraction of the price. I have found my new go to battery brand!!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Very impressed with this batteries, I am an energizer consumer and had been for years before descovering amazon basics"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I ran a test with these batteries because I was skeptical. I ran a Sennheiser wireless mic transmitter for nearly twelve hours and the receiver ran for over 16. These are great numbers. I can get through a full day of shooting with a handful of these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries without a doubt have lasted longer than any other we've tried!! :-)As long as these continue to provide such long lasting quality, we'll keep buy them!Thanks Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't restart without another fresh set of batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,They were very good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,As good as any other brands like rayovac or that other one I cant think of .
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,very nice
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very nice product and I'm very happy with it. My experience with this seller was excellent. I would not hesitate to deal with them again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Been using these batteries for almost a year. Very pleased with them
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seller has a real value pack in this quality battery for the price. Very pleased with the manner in which the product was boxed and then packaged for delivery - Very secure packaging and this was important considering the product. I'll be buying again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Bought these for laser tag guns I purchased for my sons birthday (each requires 4) and they have literally played all night and morning and they are still going strong. I've bought much more expensive brand name batteries that haven't lasted this long. For the price I'm very pleased with this purchase!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Stock up. Always top notch..no leaks yet. Main brands have wrecked many of my Mag Lights and other equipment. Very well made.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is my 3rd order of AmazonBasics batteries. Very pleased.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,First eight batteries I tried barely had a charge at all! Don't wast your money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Don't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good price, good product"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love Amazon batteries seem to last long.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"High quality item, just as described. Very fast shipping. Very satisfied customer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am very satisfied with these batteries. I have ordered them before and not experienced any problems. Good quality and value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Lot's of claims in the description and lots of good reviews here, so I don't know what went wrong, but it appears these batteries really stink.In a TV remote, a pair of these batteries lasted 2 weeks. The name-brand batteries they replaced had lasted several months.In an LED flashlight, a pair of these batteries lasted exactly 2 uses before the light got dim and 3 uses before the batteries were totally dead. I'm talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don't know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations. Either way, back to name-brand batteries for me."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Very short life. I was really expecting a decent battery, but unfortunately it wasn't."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Horrible. Amazon batteries are the WORST!! I have a battery operated little decorative light string. 2 Duracell batteries will light those things for weeks. 2 amazon batteries last about (and I'm not kidding) maybe 4 hours. Complete waist of money. Dollar store batteries are better. Do NOT purchase these
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I didn't have high expectations for these batteries - inexpensive as they were. But they've managed to last at least as long as the name brand we've purchased in the past! With a 4 year old and several battery operated toys, we seemingly traded our consumption of diapers for batteries - we need to buy them by the case. Trying to keep the toys off when not in use and 'save' the batteries is a concept my 4 year old does NOT grasp. So while he's having a great time with a toy in the evening, by morning it was dead. So fresh batteries to the rescue. AmazonBasics batteries are not only cost effective, but they have a life span at least equal to previous name brand batteries we've bought.We will be buying more of these (probably a LOT more!)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was not expecting much when i bought these batteries. I was proven wrong. Weve had these same batteries in everyday devices, including a kids toy that is used daily, for 2 months. With duracell batteries i was replacing them about once a month in this very same toy. They are still going strong. I will be buying these from now on. Name brands do not compare to these batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Four in the batch leaked and caused a mess in my charger and device. I threw out the remaining to avoid future problems. In addition, the batteries didn't hold their charge. I presume I must have received a bad batch based on all the positive reviews."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. Pay a little more for quality batteries that work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Spend the money and buy a name brand. These seriously do not work at all. Such a waste of money
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These batteries are ok, i've already had to replace them in my wireless keyboard, which had previously lasted 6 months on el cheapos from harbor freight."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries DO NOT last. They are a waste of money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries don't last long. Waste of money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries last 5 minutes. Waste of money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I just open several new, cello packs to use in a motorized window shade cartridge. Loaded them up, plugged the cartridge in - nothing. Took the batteries out and checked each one in a battery tester. 3 of the 12 batteries were good. I opened up several more new packages and tested them before loading them into the cartridge. One out of every five had a charge, and the ones that had a charge were not strong charges. The rest are going to battery recycling. When it comes to batteries, you get what you pay for."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These are awful. So far I've used them in my toothbrush, and have had to replace them 3 times in 6 months. I've also used them in my smoke detector and had to replace them within that 6 month period as well. Seriously I usually can go a few years without replacing batteries in a smoke detector. Waste of money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Terrible batteriesDon't last longDon't depend on theseYou're better off buying batteries at the dollar store then here
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Stopped working after 6 months. Had to throw them away. What a waste.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Have tried these in various battery powered devices and they fail very quickly. I won't use them any more as I don't like having to dispose of dead batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far so good, but recently one of the AA size batteries made by Amazon was totally dead. The others so far seem to be up to par, but I wish this dead one could have been eliminated before it was sent to me."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"They perform well and the price is fine, but it's not entirely clear when it automatically switches you to AA size when you choose the larger quantity. Amazon snuck in a box of AA on me that way when I was expecting these AAA. Bad, Amazon. Bad."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Way better price than name brand like engergizer. I have a little boy who needs batteries for everything. This way he don't break the bank.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value and packaging is awesome!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Long life, great price!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,We aren't running out of batteries now for game controllers. They seem to work just as well as any name brand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"We buy a lot of batteries and was hoping we had a way to get them to us. Theseas as long as the dollar store batteries. Some items 2 weeks, others 1. I will not buy again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We've ordered these several times...seems like they actually last longer than other name brands!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works just as well as the pricier name brand version. We have 3 kids under 5 and go through batteries like its our job. Will continue to buy these from amazon from now on.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,we have had nothing but trouble with these batteries. i have installed them in multiple products and they are barely lasting any time at all. we will not be buying these again. maybe amazon can provide us with a new batch as maybe we just got unlucky with ours.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Have been using these for several months. We have young kids so many toys that go thru batteries like crazy. So far, great purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We love Amazon batteries! They seem to last as long as the name brand and are a fraction of the price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries. Very strong, and last as long as anything else out there."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We ordered these batteries all the time! The price is so much more reasonable than name brand batteries and they work just as well. We have a toddler running around our house so as you can imagine ever single toy we own needs batteries.Totally satisfied with our purchase every time!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We've been using this in our backyard laser tag guns. We have played many times and I have not had to replace them yet. They seem to be keeping their charge very well even with our guns.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,We've ordered these batteries twice now and they're great. They really last in my kids toys and for the price you can't beat it. They last in a furby that's played with just about 14 hours out of the day for over a week (which is awesome!)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,They're not strong enough to power my kids' toys... so far they only work with tv remotes. :(
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"For the price,they are well worth it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Well i am a fan of the Amazon Basic items. They are life saver for me.I don't have much to say as Amazon basic quality and economy prices are well know to everyone.Thank you Amazon for the Amazon Basic items.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Well I just received my second order of these batteries and of course they will come in handy with the holidays here. I have several of those artificial candles on my mantelpiece and they go through batteries like they are free. So now I am sure I have enough to get through the next several weeks!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I wasn't sure about buying these at first. Now I'll be buying more when I'm through with the pack. I use them for my Bose Quiet Comfort 15 and they work better than Duracell Quantum, and way cheaper. I'm not to sure on the time difference between them though, I just know I'm not changing them out as often."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries work as advertised. Well packaged and pleased with this purchase.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Can't beat the price. Well packaged, door to door what more can you ask"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,nice price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I have used Amazon Basics before and so far I have liked their products. When I was needing more batteries, I noticed Amazon had a line through their Amazon Basics company. I ordered a set and thought I would give it a try. I have not done any fancy testing for the life or usage you get from these batteries compared a name brand one, but they do work and appear to have lasted about the time amount of time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Nice batteries for the price. Second time I've bought these.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries at a great price! These really last a long time and are great for all the battery operated Christmas decorations.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These have to be the best batteries for the price. I am always having to buy batteries for all my electronic devices. When I found that Amazon had their own brand I figured I would give them a try. I have to say that they really are just as good if not better than the major name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are, umm, batteries. They are high quality. They last a decent period of time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I use these for my wireless mouse on my laptop. Not heavy use at all. But I am replacing these batteries at least once a week. I have to carry extra batteries with me, and I've never done that before. I used to go MONTHS with name brand batteries, so it's a dramatic difference. I'll use these up but I won't buy them again.That being said, this is the worst Amazon Basics product that I have bought. Everything else has been outstanding, so I'm really surprised at how bad these are.I have the AAs as well, and those don't seem to have the same problem. Maybe these are just part of a bad batch"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These batteries are fairly priced for their quality. Which is to say, they need replacing 4 or 5 times more often than a name brand battery."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It's been quite a while since I've needed batteries and I didn't want to pay the brick-and-mortar prices. They came well-packaged and according to Amazon they keep well. I haven't needed to use more than 2 but I can say that it came fully powered and I hope they keep as well as advertised!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Went through these fast at a wedding I shot. Used these in my external flashes. I'm sure it was the power of the lights but man they went quick. Lots of bang for your buck though!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,decent quality
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value for a ton of batteries for our way too many kid toys !
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I love these batteries. First they are priced cheaper than the name brands but offer the same performance. They come in no frustration packaging instead of the terrible clamshells that most batteries from the store do. The cardboard box offers a handy place to store them in without being cut by the plastic or having them fall out of the pack. Each four batteries is individually sealed so you can place them in odd drawers throughout the house close to the items they will be powering. Finally I can have all the different size high performing batteries I may need without breaking the bank. You won't be disappointed with these.Please check Yes if you have found this review helpful. I rely upon others' reviews to make an informed decision anytime I make a purchase, so it is my intention to help others do the same. I welcome any questions or feedback."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I like to buy some things,like these batteries,off brand and in bulk.No leaks,work well in all of my AA devices and battery life is,likeany store bought one,dependent on my use and quality of device.I will purchase again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What a great price. Love having extra batteries around the house at Christmas time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great price, I haven't compared them side by side with any other batteries. I haven't notice any differents in performance."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These worked for about 8 hours and then were dead. What a waste!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,What can I say. They're AA Alkaline Batteries and they're affordable.-1 Star because the packaging was GIGANTIC compared to the size of the actual batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Sets the standard, no more no less, better price than competition, so should be a clear choice!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,What can you say it's battery that works good life span. Time will tell if they leak or not. Great Buy!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I won't need batteries for a long time and comes in a real nice strong case, love it!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I've been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I've used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it's rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they're actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it's time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I'm not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors. If the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I'll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the 4th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contacting Amazon Customer Service. As I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"What happened to the green and silver amazon batteries Those worked great. These new ones are terrible. Very short battery life. I've been through two boxes of 48, thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time, same results."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,a ton of AA batteries for cheap. What is there not to like
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"What is there not to like Combined with an alkaline battery charger (like the idigital one) it works great and the batteries are really cheap. So what if these get fewer recharges, you get 4x as many for the price. Just don't charge them in a regular charger, it requires a special battery charger that specifically has alkaline support or it will explode."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries do the job.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. My experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon started this wonderful company way back when. Can you remember when there was NO Amazon, neither can I. The company became so successful at selling someone else's products, Amazon decided to start selling their own, thus Amazon Basics was born. Amazon Basic encompasses so many products, that are sold at such a reasonable price with excellent quality,that you should always look for Amazon Basics first.Recently, my Amazon Echo's remote, stopped working. I use the remote so much as a Bluetooth, information giver etc etc etc, and guessed correctly that the AAA battery had run it's last mile. I had one battery left, inserted it and off we went. I realized I need to obtain a new supply of batteries, and entity Amazon's website. I found the Amazon Basics batteries,meets price and in a quantity of eight. I am now prepared for the holiday onslaught of battery needs. Just insert into your product and off you go.Recommended. prisrob 10-20-15"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'm not a battery expert in any way. I just know that I needed batteries and these seemed cheap. I've used them in many devices and can't tell any difference in performance or longevity.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,AAA batteries at a reasonable price. No difference in longevity than any of the major brands. Just cheaper and delivered to my door. What's not to like
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Have not had a chance to use batteries through to test lifespan, but for the price, what's not to like"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I like that they come in shrink-wrapped sets of 4 each... It keeps a mess down, plus grabbing a few is really easy.They seem to hold up pretty close to the other top brands, though I've done no scientific testing! I assume if there is a difference, for practical purposes, the cost-savings would heavily outweigh the performance. However, if you're going to space, you might want to really test which batteries last longest - down to the minute."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can buy these at a good price and they seem to last as well as any of the big brands. So I will continue to buy these batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're batteries, what's not to love"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batts good price. Would repeat.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon does a good job with these batteries. When you have young kids and lots of electronics, buying in bulk and buying quality is key."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"So these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"WTH!! Went through these extremely fast - it seems there were many DUDS filtered in with a few good batteries!! by the time I realized this, it was over thirty days, so live and learn."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"A less costly alternative to the name brands, which seems to work just fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries are just TERRIFIC!!!! I did not want to pay the price for those small pkg.Copper tops.I never thought that these would be just as good.But,Amazon you proved me wrong. Great Price and Great Deal.."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work like batteries! Who reads reviews about batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are batteries. They work. Trust me. They're inexpensive. It's amazon. Stop reading reviews on batteries and just buy some.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They last a long time, have a good value, and are delivered to my door. I really can't complain."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work as well or better than name-brand batteries. Anyone with kids knows the batteries end up costing as much as the toy after replacing them multiple times. I buy them in bulk in all sizes.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Why buy expensive batteries from Target or Lowes or Home Depot These much less expensive batteries are sure to do the trick! They work just as well at a fraction of the cost its a no-brainer purchase.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These seem to be just as good as the name brands and are a much better value.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I use a lot of AAs in my xbox control due to my headphones. Name brand batteries were nickle and diming me, and then I stumbled upon a Amazon deal of the day and next thing I know I have a box of these. Literally can't see a difference in name brand batteries and these, and these are much much cheaper. Will only ever buy Amazon Batteries from now on"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I bought a pkg of name brand batteries for almost 9.00 for a pack of ten . Now these batteries I bought were about the same price in all the flyers in the area as well as the local stores . Long story short these Amizon basic batteries work much better than the batteries I bought ( more than once so different lots ) than the more expensive ones . I have lots of flameless candles that come on twice a day and I was going thru lots of batteries . Not any more . And they are running strong in other things too . Who would have thought . Fully expected to be dissatisfied to be honest because of price difference . But no . Great product .
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Why notI gave them a shot and I do not notice a negative difference from other brand batteries. The positive is the packaging. They come in 4s and so you do not have to open the entire pack for a few.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Why ever pay retail store price for a simple battery. Shelf life is so long they will still be fresh years from now. There are only a few battery manufacturers in the world. Hey Bob, what brand we running on the line today.20 each."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Yes, they're AAA batteries, and they work as advertised... batteries come in a perfectly sized compact box, which can also be kept for storage purposes. Great shelve life too!!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Pretty cheap, good, long lasting batteries. We bought these and are currently using. I was a little worried buying cheaper batteries, cause most of the time they hardly last. These do though! Anyways, no issues with it at all, great bulk buy too."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Amazon batteries work just as well as other brands, why waste your money!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They're just like the high performance AA batteries you can get anywhere else, except here they don't cost as much and you can get a whole ton of them all at once."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love love love Amazon batteries. Every one that I've ordered performed just as well as the name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries, last a long time with full power."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price for alot of batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,My husband uses these in a night vision scope. He says they last longer than the name brand
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very happy with my purchase of these. We fly thru batteries at my house so this was a good investment. The ones I've used so far seem to be working great and haven't died yet.This would be great for Christmas time toys!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far these have held up. No reason to just but a few of any brand battery... So I bought a whole bunch. They're good. I don't keep track of how long Duracell or Energizer or Amazon run in things because remotes, video games, etc always go through spells of being the favorites at different times at our house. I know they work :) they're cheaper! The way i do tell is how fast I go through them and I still have a lot left from this same pack. So considering, these are equal to the other name brand and costly batteries that i've been stuck on for years. Time for a change )"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great deal seems like good quality
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great product
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I'm happy with the product and the price! Amazon basics is my new battery company!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries. Great price!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I was skeptical buying these batteries but they last just as long as the Duracell batteries that I have bought and longer than other brands I have triedI use them in my LED lights and candles so yes I use them daily
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love buying batteries from Amazon. For this many it is a great price and you don't have to carry them home from the store.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,LOTS of batteries for cheap! I've used a few of them and appear to have full charge for stuff I put them in. I like keeping stocked up on all batteries so I always have them on hand when needed. Will definitely but AmazonBasics batteries again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Have used about half of these now with no issues. They seem to last as long as the name brands and in this house double AA are always needed.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries that do what they're supposed to do and last a long time. What else is there to say Will happily buy these again. :)
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Lots of batteries for a real decent price. Will have check back to confirm they are a great deal !
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"not worth the money, they did not last very long, batteries would go dead, will not buy again"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries only last 2-3 days in my tv remote
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,BATTERIES have a very SHORT LIFE... WILL NOT RECOMMEND nor BUY AGAIN..
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Hassle free packaging and long expiration
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good price and work well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"These don't last long. Won't be buying anymore, wish they had been better!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,but do last longer than Duracell
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,do not last as long as energizer...very comparable to toys r us batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon Basics are killing it with alot of their products working great and being very reliable and these batteries are another great reason to buy into the Amazon Basics Brand :D
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Cheap batteries poor performance. I put two in our Roku remote and they died within a day. Same thing happened with the TV remote.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These batteries work. They don't last as long as I'd like but they do work fine. They came in frustration free packaging that I ended up needing scissors to open because they batteries come shrink wrapped in a little box and getting the plastic off of the batteries was NOT frustration free. So, three stars because they work but aren't great. I will probably not re-order these."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Put these AA batteries in smoke detectors and they immediately start the low battery beeps. Pulled them back out going to see about returning them all - or they will goto recycling. :-(
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,They don't seem to be working very well - - last a day or so in the remote
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my flameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. None of those worked either So I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don't understand.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Excellent quality batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Wonderful quality batteries, and they arrive in a nice little case. Recommended! (Love Amazon Basics -- all products in this line I have purchased have been superb.)"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are awesome! Just as good as the name brand for a fraction of the price! Great job Amazon!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far I can't tell the difference from other name brand batteries. Wonderful to be able to purchase batteries at this price and be delivered free by being a Prime Member.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,Over half were dead or real close to.dead and ones that did work lose power really fast. Very disappointed in Amazon on these and their aaa.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Same or better quality as other batteries at a price that beats the competition, by a considerable amount in most cases."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value. So far they seem to work just as well as name brand batteries for a fraction of the cost.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I needed some and the price is good! Liked the packaging...they don't all roll out when opened at one end (no so with some of the normal name brands)! Seem to be lasting as long as the other brands (but I will let you know if that statement changes).Amazon is a good brand. I'll reorder when I need more!Yep, I recommend this product"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work as well as the name brands and alot in price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We love these batteries. We use them on everything from led candles, remote controls, watering timers, and toys. In our non scientific testing, they seems to last just as long as any name brand battery. We keep ours in the refrigerator until we need them. No charge issues after a year of storing them."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are fine and the price is right. I normally get the box of 48 Maxell batteries and... this is not objective... but I feel like those batteries last longer. Still, these batteries are fine and do what they're intended to do. They're certainly not long-life though."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good batteries, minimal packaging. Good price per quality."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These seem to work as well as any in normal devices. They don't last long enough in the high drain but they are much cheaper than putting the lithium in everything
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Work just as they should. What more can you say, they're batteries, they work"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work fine

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Work Great, Great Value"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far these are holding up very well and for the price, couldn't pass them up."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Lots of 'em, and cheap. And they work, no leaks and last as long as 'the other guys' out there. When you have kids and 4,000 toys that take (and eat) batteries, you can't beat the price and reliability. Thank you Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great inexpensive batteries, good as any on the market!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Got these for a great deal, and they last just as long as the name brand!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great deal!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I decided to order amazon basics batteries because I've ordered some other amazon basics stuff and they seem pretty quality. These have worked fine since I've started using them and I haven't had any problems.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries are a great price and work just as well as name brand batteries.No complaints by me.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteries dont quite hold up to the same time and durability of Duracell or other name brand but they are a great alternatives! More than worth the price.

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work just as well as other but cheapeR!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Cant see any difference from the more expensive Duracell batteries. Great price. Use them for flashlights clocks, and remote controls."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These are some of the most inexpensive batteries I can find and I go through a LOT of batteries due to all of the battery powered cat toys and human toys I own.My cats have five toys that use AA batteries and my Xbox controllers use AA batteries, so I feel like I am always switching batteries out on one thing or another. In the past I would buy the cheap 4 packs of batteries from the 99cent store. They were decent, brand name and lasted about as long as the more expensive ones from a normal store. However, the 99cent store stopped selling the 4 packs and the 2 packs aren't worth the price and effort of making a special trip to a 99cent store. I bought a 16 pack of regular Duracell extra long life batteries at Target recently and went through those batteries just as fast as the 99cent store variety. Not okay.That's when I took to the internet. Good ol' Amazon has their own batteries for a much cheaper price What Perfect!I ordered a big ol' box of them and they truly do last as long as (or longer than) the name brand batteries I have purchased elsewhere but for a much better price.Now my nocturnal cats can play with their toys all night while I sleep and I can play Xbox until my fingers bleed, all for a better price. :D"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work just fine
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Wonderful batteries that seem to be well-worth the price we paid!

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries arrived on time with Prime. Batteries are packaged well for shipping and storage. Work perfect for TV remotes and kids toys
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I've become a big fan of the Amazon Basics line of batteries over the years. They work just as well as the name brands we're all familiar with and I have never run across any of the Amazon Basics batteries that were dead in the box. We seem to run through the AAA size in various remote controls like crazy around here, so buying them in the multi pack box is both convenient and a money saver."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work just as well as any other battery. No issues with leaks or other battery problems. Cheaper than most competitors as well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries work pretty well and you can't beat the price

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Seem to work ok, but less than Energizer in my camera. Otherwise they are a great item with a great price."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work well in heavy duty use, I use them for my bicycle lights"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Work like batteries should, got a bunch cheap"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Work well and cheaper than name brand batteries you buy at the store.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Work well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I used to buy bulk energizer batteries at the club stores but these are cheaper, delivered to my home, and work just as well. Will definitely continue to purchase."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,So far so good with these Amazon Basic batteries as i have only had them for a short period. Only time will tell how they perform or if they are prone to leakage over time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They work!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Work well so far, but cannot tell yet long term"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I go through a lot of AA batteries, and AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries are among the best I've used for the price. Costing less than 25 cents per cell, they cost about 40-50 less than name brand batteries. I use the AmazonBasics batteries in all sorts of electronic devices, and I don't see any noticeable difference between them and the name brand alkaline batteries. These are excellent batteries for the price."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,worked great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Worked as advertised!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Worked as expected, they last as long as Duracell's so far. I use them in my digiscale and instant read meat and infrared thermometer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,ok for the price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Worked great and no issues. Price made purchase affordable for family and able to use desired item that needed batteries. Great product and price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"What a bargain! These seem to last about the same as the generics you'd buy at your local department store, but at half the price, especially when you get them on subscribe and save. Worked great to battery up all the Christmas goodies this year."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,"I loved these batteries until 2 nights ago when one exploded in my camera flash. Not worth saving money on batteries when I now have to replace a 400 professional Nikon Flash. Battery acid leaked out of my flash door and all over my Nikon D600 camera and then on my hands before I realized what the loud,pop sound was."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Worked great!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Worked great!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Worked perfectly, as described."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries work just as good as any other alkaline battery, have not had one leak yet. and the price can't be beat."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Seemed to work just like any other batteries. My boys have had them running in their remote control cars for hours.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far works great
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These batteres worked great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We always seem to be running out of batteries no matter how many we purchase. I have used other Amazon Basics products in the past, so I thought I would give these a try. The batteries appear to be very similar to any other AAA battery one might purchase. I do have a better tester, and was able to confirm the ones I tested were fully charged.We have been using some of the batteries for a week or so now in various items (weight scale / remote), and they appear to be performing just fine. Of course, the real test will be to see if they last as long as the batteries they replaced. But, at least for now, I am going to give them 5-stars based upon how they are currently performing."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These are working pretty well for me. They might be lasting SLIGHTLY less long than brand name Energizers. But they also cost a little less. Overall I'd say it's a push between brand names and these based on cost per time they last. But they work fine.None of that is said with any kind of scientific testing. That's anecdotal based on how often I feel like I'm replacing batteries.The short version is that I'm happy with these and would buy them again.I got a pack of AAA's too and those work fine as well
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Used 4 from this pack right away, and they seem to be fine."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"This item is at amazing price point for all of us that use lots of batteries !!Usually I buy my batteries for much higher price ,The price is super rightAnd working rest so farHighly recommend"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Typically, I stick to Duracell so I was sceptical about 'Amazon brand' batteries. And buying them definitely gave my family more fuel to tease me about my alleged Anazon addiction. So far, they're working well. They're keeping the Wii Remote alive, which is vital to our Netflix usage. Plus, the price was amazing (8.49 for a 24 pack of AA, wow!) I'll update my review if this opinion changes.UPDATE: I bought these on June 10th, 2017. On that day, I replaced the Wii remote with 2 of the batteries. Today, which is July 12, 2017, they needed to be replaced. Subsequently, I can say that these lasted just a little over a month. Note that the remote is used a lot. Duracell batteries usually last almost 2 months, but since they cost over 2 times what these cost, I'm still overall happy with the Amazon brand."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Are a real budget beater
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Cheap Quality Batteries
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,does what its suppose to do but doesn't really seem to have a lot of juice in them

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Keeps the remote for the TV working so my lazy butt does not have to get up and manually change channels!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I purchased these for the office and they worked so well, I order a set for home. With an 8 year old boy, we go through an insane amount of batteries. These work as well as the name brands. Definitely will be purchasing again."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Bought these for use in a wireless mic transmitter. With that being said the transmitter gets use very consistently for the same amount of time every week. I went through a box of Duracell and would change the batteries every 3 or 4th week consistentl. With these Amazon Basics Battery I have been changing every 4th week. In short, my experience is these batteries perform just as good or better than the Duracell."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"works as intended, purchased this for my point and shoot camera"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"The title says it all.It's nice to buy cheaper batteries. My kids go through them at an amazing rate. I think that they also give them to neighborhood kids. Amazingly, as soon as I bought these, their battery usage dropped so this box will last longer than I anticipated.The Amazon Basics batteries seem to last as long as name brand, although I haven't done any scientific testing. I know that I have no problems with them in my flashlights.These are definitely at the top of my listOf things to buy from Amazon."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"We go through a lot of batteries so I started buying AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (100-Pack). I find the these batteries last as long as other name brands, so I'd rather buy this big 100 pack of batteries and save money."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Lasts as long as the name brands for a fraction of the cost. I also like the minimal packaging that is also easy to open.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,These work as well as name brand version.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,works fine.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I see reviews of these batteries mostly on one end of the spectrum or the other. I love em' or I hate em'. Seems leakage is the culprit in bad reviews. I have had no problems with the AA size batteries I ordered.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Just cheap batteries.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"As advertised, works fine. Fast shipping. Have bought before and will but again."

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works great so far, only small gripe is they stink (like paint thinner). Weird yes I know, but nonetheless they work and that's all that counts!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works great what more can I say. Several months in the mouse so far
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works great we use them for our kids toys and remotes and other things in the house. Will definitely buy again. Last a long time.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Update 6/16/17: Purchased product again and they are working in the devices that they did not work in prior. Also, I believe the batteries are lasting longer than the batteries I purchased prior (maybe fresher... )When they work, they work great. I have a number of 'devices' that for whatever reason, they do not power up with these batteries. I can replace with a non AmazonBasics battery and it starts working. I do not see any difference in length, circumference,etc so not sure what is going on. With that said, they work great in this devices where there is not a compatibility problem."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Cheap batteries and they work well. What more is there to say
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Amazon Basics really makes some good products!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries! Yeah!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work great and are such an amazing value!! We will continue to buy amazonBasic batteries! We have them in remote controls, electronics, kids toys, you name it they are in it and they last a good amount of time!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These work great. I purchased these to use in my audio recorder for my college class. It is a 4 hour class Mon-Fri and i keep it on the whole time, including the 30 min lunch break, i just pause it. These batteries have lasted much longer then the typical energizer batteries i have used for this class."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works Great!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Exactly as described. Works great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,No complaints. Works just as good and lasts just as long as the name brands. They will give a pink bunny a run for his money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works just as good as other name brand batteries. I can't speak for longevity as these are used in devices that either gets used a lot or sometimes not for a week at a time. So far I would buy again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So happy I found these batteries. Constantly replacing batteries for toys in the house. These work just as well and much cheaper
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Better price, quick delivery!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seem to be long-lasting. Works just great.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Just got a large box of these home and installed them in two thermometers, a couple LED/fake candles, and a flashlight. Everything turned on like normal and appears to be functioning fine. My only concern is that these felt a little lighter than the (used up/dead) name brand batteries I was replacing, but these were much, much more affordable."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works just like the more expensive Duracell or enigizeer batteries for a fraction of the cost. The last just as long too.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Works well for the price point and is completely comparable to name brand batteries. I will be purchasing all of my future battery needs from amazon basics.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I am so glad to have found these batteries on Amazon. They work great last as long as most popular brands with the added benefit of being much more affordable. Thank you for such a great product that's affordable. I am now able to stock up on all my batteries never be without one when I need one.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Works perfectly, I'm interested to see how they hold up over time."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"So far, the batteries are working well but I've only had them a week so it's still way too early to tell to see how long they last. I use them in my TI-84. But, I love that the price is cheap for a small pack."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,It lasted me little over 3 months on the firetv remote and I use the remote daily.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"great product, fast delivery by amazon!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,works awesome and can get them on good sales!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries work pretty well. They don't seem to outlast Kirkland or Duracell, but they are a good value for the ."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works well. Fairly easy too program for your specific area.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love these batteries! Wonderful price and a great product!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Batteries work well and last a 'normal' amount of time. I'm not a battery expert, nor did I compare different types of batteries in some type of battery experiment, but I didn't notice they died out any quicker than your average battery.... I'm satisfied!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Worst batteries ever. I bought these and put them in the drawer till needed. I have thrown out every single one trying to find 3 that work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I don't even want to give this a star, worst batteries ever, lasted 15 minutes top. Do not buy"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Shortest life batteries ever, waste of money"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,What went wrong These are the worst AAA batteries I've ever purchased. Make that the worst batteries ever purchased. I've used over half of them so far and I'm getting about 25 of the life I previously got from Duracell and other brand names.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Our experience with all Amazon batteries have been bad. They dont last nearly as long as a Duracel or Energizer. I literally replaced my computer mouse battery with an Amazon AAA battery 2 days ago and its already out. We have to replace everything that has an Amazon battery constantly. Will not buy these again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Worst product. Have to trash it out, because I was so upset. Did not serve the propose I bought it for."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"I will never purchase batteries online ever again! I should have never believed that this is Unique Japanese technology that enables better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures, because frankly IT DID NOT EVEN LAST FOR TWO DAYS FOR MY DIGITAL CLOCK THAT HAS FOUR PLACEMENTS OF AAA BATTERIES. At first I believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries, no problem, THEN, a week and a half has passed and I had to change the batteries for my clock FIVE TIMES! I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, but it is frustrating to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product. Well that's that, have a good one!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,die hard Ray O Vac user but due to price I am trying these based on reviews.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Finally I have enough batteries! A nice supply of batteries that seem to last as good as any and better than many. They came in a package that was good for storing them. A very useful battery as many products use them today.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Brought these because, I'm always forgetting to get battery's. I now find it easier to buy forgetful things from amazon. These battery's are lasting a nice amount of time. I brought it for my WII and haven't had to change the battery since I put it in. Great buy for a great product."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Batteries are perfect
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good batteries and a fantastic price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Bargain
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Good bargain, great price and last as long as brand name batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Great batteries, last a long time. Great price and great bang for your buck!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I've been using AmazonBasics batteries for the last few years and they have worked perfect in everything. From toys to electronics they work just fine and have solid battery life.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Price - great cheaper than box storesQuality - lasted longer in my trail cameras than any other battery i have purchased in the past 4 years
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,Seem to work fine I love Amazon what a great price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So far so good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"They don't hold a lot of charge, but it's a lot of AAs"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"When you have kids, you go through AA batteries like they are water. These are great and last just as long as the name brand versions."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These are a great value and seem to last almost as long as Duracells. I would recommend them. I've had a pair in a remote for almost a year now, still going strong."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Don't last long in my remote or the bathroom toilet light, which rarely comes on but is used every night.But then again, ALL batteries don't seem to last as long as they used to. So comparatively to Duracel, they're worth the ."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I bought an 8 pack that worked perfectly so perfect that I later bought a 20 pack. The 20 pack I had an issue with that was quickly resolved. the issue wasn't enough to deter me from buying in the future. These are really good batteries and I'll definitely be buying these again.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Function as promised!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,I think these batteries last just as long if not longer than the other more expensive brands.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for a cheap price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Love this product. I wasn't expecting this before I bought it. It is a lot cheaper than the other product. But it's actually working pretty well.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good deal.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Great durability and long lasting at portion of price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"These batteries are good, but do not have the power and length of service as the copper top batteries. The main benefit is that they have not leaked and ruined my electronics like the copper tops do."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Well made and work very well, so why pay NAME BRAND prices I shall buy these again!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"I bought these batteries mostly because I was giving gifts to my nieces and nephews and they all needed either AA or AAA batteries and buying packages separately can get really expensive. I have been using these AAA batteries in some of my own electronics and they work well. They don't have the longest life but they don't die super fast either. I can get a good amount of use from these batteries. Of course it depends on how often and how long I use the devices but I don't notice a dramatic difference between these and higher end brand name batteries. For the price, I am happy with these. I have not had any leak and none so far have been duds. I am going with 4 stars. Not the best you can buy but certainly worth the price!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Cheaper than others but work just as good, if not better."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,great product and price

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,fantastic batteries at a reasonable price
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,The batteries are good.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Would like to see larger bricks of batteries 250 - 500 easier to ship to the boys overseas we can't mail the lithium so these will have to do but we need to send in larger quantities

AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,wow what value i just found my new brand of batteries last just as long as the duresall and eneagiser
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Dude. These lights are so amazing! They are the perfect addition underneath our kitchen cabinets. I really love the remote, which allows you to not only dim the lights, but it also has a timer! The individual lights came with two small screws to install, as well as 3M tape. We used the screws for a more durable effect. The lights also came with brand new batteries in them to get you started! As an interior decorator and stager, I'll tell my clients about these. Great product!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),2,I received AAA batteries and have reordered AA batteries as originally ordered.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Wrong size!! Just awful. Not worth money
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,All those Christmas toys now work!!!YAY
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I was super excited to try these Amazon brand items and I'm sure glad they are branching out. I really just dislike Walmart and they terrible customer service. So typically I purchase batteries from BJ as I have two kids with tons of toys! Amazons prices for their batteries beats BJS by 5 to 6 depending on the size plus even at BJs you can't get a 48 pack of AA. The packaging was and simple which is fine because it does nothing for me. I must say that I like opening the package better with Amazon than normal batteries because I hate the thick plastic it's hard to cut and sometimes sharp, plus Amazons packaging is better for the environment. I just installed some batteries yesterday and I'll update as to how long they last"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Works as good or better than the Rabbit brand for less money.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Not bad, not great. They do as their told."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,So nice to have a big pack of batteries for whenever I need them. These were a great deal and way cheaper than buying them at a local store. Work and function as expected and described.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Yep
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They're batteries. They make things that run on batteries work. They're cheap. They don't die after 30 minutes.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Good value and quantity for the price. Will keep buying.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,good
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"Best bang for buck on batteries, and always good to have a small stock of them on hand for whatever you might need.split this with my roommate, and so we now each have some AAA and we also split a pack of AA, great for the controllers that dont get used regularly, toys, remotes, whatever, if you plan ahead, it is worth it."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,you always look for them and don't have them. Now I just get them every other month on auto-order
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,I have so many devices that require AA batteries. This was a great deal. These batteries last nearly as well as any I've ever used.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"These batteries work in all the AA devices!!11!! I'm talking Xbox 360 controllers, Xbox One controllers, Wireless Keyboards, Wireless Mouseses, TV Remotes, Xbox 360 Remotes, Xbox One Remotes. I imagine they would work on other Controllers and stuff too as long as they take AA batteries and not AAA batteries because those are smaller you know. You can take a AAA batterie though and wrap it up in aluminumun foil and itll work in a damn AA device except that the battery gets all hot in the foil and I get scared thinking it might explode on me and I feel like I hold the Controller over my damn Pecker a lot because thats just where I hold you know, and it might hurt me, you know, down there, and I need to make sure I keep it all in tact for just in case if I ever get the chance to meet a woman maybe a mexican or something i can order off the internet for less than an american girl because i dont have too much money but i'm good at xbox specifically, i never have owned a damn playstation"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,All perfection as usual for Amazon
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,You can't beat them for the price and quantity. How many times do you need a battery and cannot find one but with this many it takes a while.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,You can't beat these batteries when it comes to price. My son has seemingly a million toys that require batteries and it's always handy to have some around when he leaves them on (thomas the train motorized engines). Buying these from Amazon saves me a lot of money vice buying them from a major retailer. Thanks Amazon!Pro: cheap and reliable
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,This is my second time buying Amazon brand batteries. My son is an avid gamer so he eats batteries like crazy!! You can beat these batteries. They are a great price and last just as long as the name brand! I'll buy again and again!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I don't use a lot of the AAA size, but I needed a couple -- and I wanted spares. They're top quality, and a better price than local stores (including house brands)."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,you certainly get what you pay for....I bought these because the cost was about half of what I pay for name brand batteries. They last about 25 as long as the brand batteries. Hmmmm...paid half for something that lasts one quarter......My financial advisor is still wagging his finger at me
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,You get a lot for a great price! I mainly just use them for my xbox one controller and they last for quite a long time!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"They are batteries. You get a lot for a great price. They work. Yay, batteries!"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great batteries for an excellent price! Why pay more Free shipping with Prime. It doesn't get any better.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"At first we were completely happy with the Amazon Basics line of batteries. Reasonably priced and what we thought was good quality. Well, after a couple months of use in one of our daughters toys, two out of the three batteries that were in the device burst. This is nothing I have experienced with Duracell or Energizer. Will be switching back to Duracell Procell."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"These are okay. They aren't as long-lasting as name brands so in the end, I'm probably not saving money using these. That said, I like how they are packaged so they take up little space and we only have to open a 4 pack each time while still having plenty on hand. This beats the big packages of the name brands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,These batteries are good for the remote or other things that arent using constant power. Ive burned through a lot of these quickly with electronics that require energy for extended use. The jurys still out on whether its better to buy a smaller pack of higher quality batteries or this pack theyre both basically the same price.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,Not the best.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"You can't beat the price, but I've had some of these batteries just die on me after less than a month of use."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,"Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"The price and packaging on these batteries is wonderful, but the use-life is not. A pair of these, fresh out of the box, did not last 30 days in my Bluetooth mouse. I have gotten better results with rechargeables, and that is saying something."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,"Good batteries just tested them, but there were only 98 batteries. I want my two batteries-- grr"
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,"I am just speechless with these batteries. They are probably the best deal for good quality batteries you will ever find. I feel like they should cost more because they are really good and last a long time. In a way, I feel like they can compete with Duracell batteries."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They worked just great!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Great value and great product
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Every bit as good as top brand name batteries. Why pay 2-3 times more This is a super deal.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Very happy with these!!
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),3,"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment."
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),4,they work. I don't know the life span or how well they work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,they are batteries. they work. who could ask for more
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,They are batteries: not exciting but they work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,Yup. Batteries. They work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),5,and they work.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),1,Everyone read the 1 star reviews..the 5 star reviews must be people reviewing immediately. The 10 year promise is crap. I have 48 AA and 36 AAA batteries that are all dead after 1 year. The Dollar Tree batteries are better. Pay the extra money and don't fall for Amazons broken promises or guarantees.
AmazonBasics Nylon CD/DVD Binder (400 Capacity),5,Great case to keep everything in its place! My husband love it!!!! Holds a lot of cds!
AmazonBasics Nylon CD/DVD Binder (400 Capacity),5,"After discarding and getting rid of broken cd cases, broken cds, and selecting those ones we really like, this binder turned up to be an excellent option to store our favourite cds and dvds and keep them in a small space at our living room, giving us the choice to donate or get rid of those cds towers that took a lot of room, despite looking nice. And because you can turn the pages, you can spot the cd you want to play without the hassle of taking it from a case that is falling apart. After storing them cds, all the cases and printed covers went straight to the recycling centre. We have a small version to put those cds my husband would like to listen to whenever he must drive away for work."
AmazonBasics Nylon CD/DVD Binder (400 Capacity),5,"A few dollars more, but I am boycotting amazon"
AmazonBasics Nylon CD/DVD Binder (400 Capacity),2,"My initial impression of this was very good. The material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my Hama CD binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget CD binders.There are 50 pages with 8 disc pockets each (4 per side) giving a total of 400 capacity. The pages are hung from the spine in two groups of 25. By that I mean that 25 pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spine.This is where the first problem with this binder lies. Because each group of 25 pages shares the same anchor point in the spine, the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs. They bend and arch, and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film. With long-term usage I suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension. It also makes it awkward to browse the binder as the pages don't sit flat. It may even crack or bend your discs.I look to my Hama 120 binder to see how it *should* be done - it only has 30 pages and yet they were smart enough to hang them from the spine in 3 bundles of 10. This spreads out the pages and allows easy browsing of the binder without putting any of the pockets under tension.After just 2 weeks in storage I opened the binder and the corners of all the pages have become dog-eared by themselves. This is due to the poor design and poor fit of the binder pages when filled with discs. Again, it is not a problem I have seen with my other disc binders, my two-year-old Hama binders look as good as new.Overally this binder has a lot of storage at a good price. If that's all you want you will probably be happy with the product. But sloppy design prevents it from being anything more than a mediocre binder. I feel that whoever designed this did not bother to fill it with discs to see how it would cope."
Amazon Echo ‚Äì White,5,Pros: Standard Echo. Cons: Older generation Echo. Other Thoughts: Arrived on time and was new in box.
Amazon Echo ‚Äì White,5,"Pros: Got it for under 50, much impressive sound than 2nd gen. Has every other functionality. Cons: May be not trendy looking as newer, but still sets well on my kitchen island"
Amazon Echo Show - Black,5,Pros: I love the Alexa series so when this one went on sale I had to get it with a camera. Now I can watch my security cameras from my couch or even drop in and see whats going on in other places. The audio is nice and loud and the picture is clear Cons: I wish I could stop the screen from turning off I keep thinking its unplugged but its saving power I guess
Echo Spot Pair Kit (Black),4,"ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE SCREEN IS SMALL, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE DEVICE. FOR THOSE THAT PREFER A LARGER SCREEN, THE ECHO SHOW WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE."
Echo Spot Pair Kit (Black),5,"I wasn't sure I even wanted this item, but caught up in all the excitement surrounding the Alexa enabled devices. Well....after getting it home I became addicted and ordered two Echos for the entertainment stand and today I have to Sub coming. I can't say enough for the product as well as the quick service/pick up at the Target store. Great service and product!"
Fire TV Stick Streaming Media Player Pair Kit,5,"Pros: Works good like Alexia Cons: setting it up is a , HASLE had to call verizon three times Other Thoughts: I WOULD RECOMMEND IT"
Fire TV Stick Streaming Media Player Pair Kit,5,"Pros: Relatively easy to setup and works quite reliably. Cons: The mirror cast function didn't seem to work well displaying video while it was steaming to a Windows 10 laptop. Other Thoughts: This product was recommended to me by a coworker and I was skeptical at first, but the product has turned out to be what I now rely on for most of my entertainment access."
Fire TV Stick Streaming Media Player Pair Kit,5,"Pros: I WOULD recommend anyone who was going to purchase anything , newegg is the BEST PLACE TO LOOK ! Cons: No compaints"
Fire TV Stick Streaming Media Player Pair Kit,5,"Pros: Allows you to cut your cable. With many apps to download and many apps that allow you free use of services such as streaming as long as you have a Cable provided (at least for the internet), you can log in and stream. You can use apps like Kodi and TubiTV to watch many shows. My favorite is TubiTV. Yes, there are commercials but not as many as other services.Buy this, check it out, enjoy your freedom from cable TV! Cons: Don't really have any complaints."
Fire TV Stick Streaming Media Player Pair Kit,5,"Pros: I'm a subscriber to DirectTV Now! So i pay a yearly discount and get over 450+ channels streamed to my TV for 59 a month, I pay for Prime/Netflix. combined, My cable bill was 172.00 I get more choices options, and I got the components to run it off ethernet, so no lag.I have un-metered fiber optic, so I can stream a lot, given how my family is good at leaving it running. Cons: TV's in which HDMI ports don't extend out make this difficult to install, My 4K TV has side ports took me like 4 minutes. Wireless is pointless and get the ethernet addon"
Fire TV Stick Streaming Media Player Pair Kit,5,Pros: Very satisfied I am about buy online this side wonderful service good Quality seal pack and good packing Cons: Great Other Thoughts: I am satisfied thanks
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Bulk is always the less expensive way to go for products like these
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Doesn't seem to last as long in some devices as other brands but good for the cost.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,ive not had any problame with these batteries have ordered them in the past been very pleased.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Well if you are looking for cheap non-rechargeable batteries that last quite a while then these are perfect. Nothing more to say.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,The battery life is much poorer compared to name brands like energizer and Duracell.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These don't last as long as name brand of batteries like Duracell or energizer. They are cheaper but I'd rather pay a little bit more and have them last a lot longer.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I am not a fan of off-brand batteries and so far have been disappointed by off-brand battery performance. I have decided to give these batteries a try and thus far they have performed as expected. At this time I have a number of Amazon batteries because they are low cost.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"just got em so I can't really comment on how good the do the job, good price, quick delivery but have only put two into one of my keyboards but they can go up to a year so who can say after three days"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,we have many things that need aa battery they are great
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,This my second order and they seem to work as good as name brand and ship to my door.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,This was my second purchase of amazon batteries and they work great. Just as good or even better than name brand batteries and half the price. This will be the only way I purchase batteries from now on!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I find these batteries fail in a short time on items like wireless thermometers and wall clocks. On an average changing is required within a month. I would not purchase these again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I use them for my Xbox controllers and they last pretty long. Great for a cheap price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,3 of them exploted and damage my charger that I bought here what is going to happen with my charger not satisfied with the batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"At first, i was not sure and going to get the name brand batteries, Then i was like, let me just give them a try, its made by Amazon so i must be good. When i got them i was very happy because they are Great batteries. Last very long time, the big plus is the price . You get a great product for a low price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Excellent
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good deal on a great product!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,great value
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"AmazonBasics AA batteries save me a lot of time and money going to the store and buying them pack by pack, it is very cost efficient to but these for my budget friendly family of 5.I love that this is a big pack of batteries, 20 in all making the price drop down to about .38 cents a battery. I use these in everyday things from remotes, to flash lights. They work just as good as the more expensive batteries saving me lots of cash.I turn to the AmazonBasics brand when it comes to all of my office needs. I can't complain about any of their products I bought so far. Now it's time to buy a big pack of AAA batteries from AmazonBasics. I highly recommend these batteries to anyone out there looking to buy a great quality pack of batteries. These are great for products that have a highly running life like babies products or toys. They defiantly can keep up with my family without wasting ton of money."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Amazon basics AA batteries are satisfactory for the cost. Being Alkaline the seem to work fine in most things.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,When in ordered there batteries I was not sure what to expect. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I tested each and everyone one for voltage which was 1.61V and made in Indonesia. The last batteries I purchased were Energizer's Industrial grade which also carried the same 1.61 volts. The expiration date on these Amazon basics AAA's is 2027 so I expect them to have a good shelf life I believe these batteries will perform every bit as well as the energizers I last purchased. I took advantage of the snail mail delivery I received a 5 Amazon credit which made this deal even better. From the reviews I've read I would highly recommend purchasing these batteries over any name brand for General use purposes as I'm not sure how they would stand up too I drain situations. But I will get back to you on that one with my next purchase.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I use these batteries mainly for wireless mouse and kid toys and I gotta say I'm very satisfied, they perform the same as any other battery manufacturer I have tried in the past. Highly recommend it!"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I started buying these large packs of Amazon batteries because of the great value and previous experience with Amazon Basic products.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,GREAT!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"First of all- buying batteries is never fun . It's also quite expensive. I fell in love with the fact , I could buy these Amazon branded batteries through prime and get them in two days .But guess what. I got them in 1 day!!! Plus , I stocked up for all those dang Christmas toys for my triplets. If I buy one, I have to buy three!!!!They lasted just as long as a standard battery . Plus , I love that they come in a nice cardboard sleeve. Rather than the ones at the store where they all fall out when you rip the plastic from the cardboard.To wrap up- these were very impressive."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,WORST batteries EVER. I thought there would be no appreciable difference between these and Duracell. I was wrong. Mouse was VERY sluggish and would sometimes stop working with these batteries. Replacing them with another set of these batteries did not help. My husband thought the computer had a virus. Problem SOLVED with Duracell. I will not be purchasing these batteries again. Amazon FAIL.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Batteries can be expensive! However, Amazon has taken the opportunity to sell a good quality product. There are plenty of batteries for the cost, and in these times of uncertainty we need to be prepared for our family. During times of power outage batteries are so comforting because they allow us to maintain a sense comfort. They also sell these in triple a, c, and d. The price is good compared to other brands, and the quality of Amazon is backing the product. Safe and good buy for any consumer."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Everything we have around the house uses batteries, so we go through them fast. I like purchasing in bulk because I don't have to purchase them as often and they are a little cheaper that way. I was a little nervous to purchase the AmazonBasics brand, because I wanted to make sure that I purchased a quality battery. We normally purchase Duracell.I am happy to see that the quality is just as good as the other brands we've purchase and at a fraction of the cost.We will be purchasing these again in the future."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I thought I would give these AA batteries a try. I have always used Kirkland brand and never had a problem. These are a few cents cheaper. I will see how long they last compared to Kirkland brand (Costco).
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Battery purchases don't get any better than this.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,GREAT VALUE
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The Amazon batteries seems to have an acceptably long life compared to much more expensive brand names. My one complaint is that they recently upsized the box the smaller package was much more convenient to store the batteries in.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,you can't go wrong with this. quality is as good as brand name products.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries are just as good as the name brands like duracell or energizer that I normally would purchase.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I love these batteries from Amazon and will continue to buy them for my controllers for gaming as they are strong enough to deal with them. I get a long life from these. As long as I do from my Duracells! I complete this review after either I or an immediate family member has tested the product thoroughly. Sometimes I have very little to say about a product if it works and it does what it is advertised. Sometimes I wax effusive, or rather poetic. Either way please be assured that we have tested the product and have been honest with you. If my review is helpful for you or makes sense, please indicate Yes below. Thank you for reading my review."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Have had zero issues with longevity or voltage. As good as the major brand batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"People kept saying, They're as good as Duracell but I didn't believe it until I tried them myself."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"As a Mom of 3 young kids, we go through batteries very quick! I've tried all types of batteries from name brand, to various store brands. Amazon compares to the top brands I've used, and in fact I would consider it a top brand. They last twice as long in my son's wireless PlayStation controllers than the Toys R Us brand we were previously using. You can't beat the price for the quality and I will only buy Amazon batteries from now on!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I have used these batteries for several years. As good, if not better than any other top name brand."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Awesome little batteries for flashlights, remote controls etc. They always have the greatest deals on Amazon and Amazon prime especially. I love the fact that you can get batteries at an awesome price in a hurry when store prices are ridiculous."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Amazon Basics - you are my hero. These are great batteries. I use them in my Apple keyboard and mouse and they have outlasted the brandname batteries I used to use. I get on average an additional 1-2 weeks of use out of each set of batteries which is an additional money saver. The shelf life seems to be normal for alkaline batteries.The packaging is biodegradable which adds to the convenience and value.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Bye bye big name, expensive batteries!! Holy moly! I never knew that Amazon sold batteries. In all the years I've been shopping here! I came across these while searching for batteries to use with my son's toys (they all take a ton) as well as for use in products around the house. I took a look at the reviews and decided they were definitely worth trying out! Of course I used my Prime shipping and they arrived in 2 days. Once they arrived we put 3 in my son's toy train and BAM! off it took with speed! Even my son said wow, the train is going faster than ever haha! I'm currently using these in his toys, the wall clock, the meat thermometer and many other items! I certainly recommend these batteries. They came packaged nicely in groups of 4, tucked into a cute little cardboard box. At a fraction of the cost of the big name batteries and they work JUST AS WELL if not BETTER!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail about these batteries. Other reviewers here have done a fantastic job of doing that. Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,These are good batteries. How do I know. I installed these in my electric tooth brush 2 months ago. The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I love these batteries. I am so happy that I bought them. Batteries are super expensive at my local retailer. It's sad when the batteries cost more than the thing you are putting them into. I paid about the same amount to get 48... Yes 48 AA batteries from Amazon as I would have paid to get 8 from my local retailer. I needed batteries for my new game trail camera. It takes 8 AA batteries and I was fearful that I was going to go into the poor house trying to keep fresh batteries in my trail camera. I went shopping online at Amazon and found these. I bought these several weeks ago. I used 8 AA from this box in my new trail camera. I am so happy with them. My trail camera has been in the woods several weeks and the batteries are still over 90 charged and that's after taking tons of video of game. These are working great and I saved a ton of cash. I am buying a box of the AAA now. I always seem to need them around the house for some reason. I am very happy with my new batteries from AmazonBasics. They are working great for me.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Died after 5 uses in my coffee frother wand. Won't buy again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,They for really fast
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These are bad batteries with very short life. I returned my first order assuming that I got a bad batch (despite the expiration date years away). Started using the replacement order in late May and already have to replace the batteries.I love Amazon Basics products and Amazon service but this product is a big dud. This is the first negative review I've ever written about a product on Amazon.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Wrong item.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries are bad. In any device the last only a very short time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Many of the batteries are no good.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"For the price a great value, will never buy another overpriced brand name battery again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,It states that the batteries last a while. But I use them for my TV remotes. And I ended up buying Energizer a few days later. They do not last. I changed batteries twice the day I got them in mail.The triple A were no better.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I more than recommend this purchase. I encourage it. The batteries work great. A bargain at the price and how many you get. I won't be buying batteries anywhere else again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Bargain, inexpensive"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries at a great value.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I used these batteries in one of my game cameras, but the life of theAmazon Basic battery did not last as long compared to name brand batteries. I really don't believe they are worth the savings when the Basics probably didn't take half the pictures in the game camera as Duracell. I will use these batteries in remote and my kids toys."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Using my el cheapo multimeter (Fluke was at work) all batteries were well within the my device's tolerance for reading resting voltage and internal resistance. No duds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapper in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name brands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charger, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Nice cheap batteries. A lot of them for the price . Will buy again in like 2 years lol

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"They are batteries, what can I say. Bought as gifts to go along with the candles."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,They are batteries... They do last a while though in the R/C toys we got for x-mas. I would buy these again over more expensive name brands.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Work
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works like they should.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Batteries are awesome!! They are cost effective and last just as long as Energizer or Duracell. I have used these in both low drain (toys and small electronics) as well as high drain devices (Cameras and high powered LED flashlights). Using the Subscribe and Save makes them even more cost effective.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,So far so good
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Batteries are larger than normal and do not fit my audio gear or guitars... if you need these for sound or audio I'd pass...
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Batteries are very good, but packaging is horrendous, which is surprising because usually Amazon does a great job with hassle free packaging, but every four bats are packaged in tough plastic. Would have been better to just place the lot of bats in a simple box without the individual plastic wrap. Will not buy again with this packaging."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I use these in my wireless mouse and a radio. I have not had to use them in my mouse yet. I have used 4 of them in one of my radios. The radio is still going strong after approximately 8 hours of play in the park and elsewhere. By the way, my radio is a small one, not a big boombox. If that makes a difference."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Price can't be beat...batteries aren't great, but they're so cheap"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Batteries came on time with no issues. Not expecting much out of them seeing how they are basic but should work. You get alot for a decent price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"They're normal batteries, I just love that I could order them online and have them shipped with the wireless mouse I ordered the same day and have them arrive at the same time!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These do not last at all. I have a very mini desk fan that takes 4 AA and they need to be changed every other day.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,stock up for christmas!these last pretty much the same as the name brands.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Perfect! Thank you
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Do you have battery-operated items Do you need AA batteries to power your items These AA batteries will power your items.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries that batterize your battery needing lifestyle.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I don't think I will ever go back to Costco to buy batteries. The price is awesome for the quantity and they last just as long as name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I haven't had these batteries long enough to tell you if they last a long time or not but for the price you can't go wrong and I trust the Amazon basic batteries to be a better value than buying Energizer or Duracell batteries online that might come from a seller who is knocking them off from China
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Came as advertised. Batteries seem to last pretty long and the price was great. Even the paging they sent it in was greatPlease Vote YES on my review!! Thank you
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great product...they seem to last just as long as other batteries that cost twice as much!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Difficult to be excited about AA batteries but everything about the purchase was as advertised. They were well packaged and even arrived several days early. They are working well. My regret is that I did not order AAA batteries at the same time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,These are working very well for us and they are economical to use-which we do a lot of.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"These are nicely packaged and initially I was impressed - I didn't have to go to the store to buy batteries, they were cheaper than alternatives, and the packaging was great. I opened the first set of 4 AAA batteries and sadly found out one was already dead. We also ordered AmazonBasics AA batteries and had the same problem. 1/4 were dead. I hope this isn't a pattern for the rest of the box."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Batteries were packaged good and seem fine
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,We like them
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"We have been using these batteries in some kids toys and they work fine. I haven't noticed them lasting longer or shorter than others. We normally purchase the Kirkland brand one from Costco, and these appear to be equivalent. Its great to have a large supply of batteries on hand when you have kids!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Batteries work fine and are less expensive then all of the others on Amazon for sell. Nothing more to say!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These work great! First time I ordered them, but they were a great price. I love ordering from Amazon and hate getting out of the house so I will continue to order these."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Batteries work perfectly. Only problem is the packaging is a little large. You will need to put them in a smaller container unless u have a ton of cupboard space.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Work well for the most part. One pack had defective batteries, but the rest so far have been fine. Last decently long."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Batteries! So far no problem with any I've received, they do the job!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Average batteries, functioning as expected, at a great price. I think I'll see if they've got some AA's at a comparable price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,They're batteries. Excellent.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,As expected
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"They're batteries, they work. I'll post about it I see they don't last very long, but I've gained a lot of trust in Amazon brand products so I'm fairly confident."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good batteries for cheap!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,they are batteries...what more can be said How long do they last who knows just got them.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,good value
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Everything was fine except a few of the batteries brand new out of the pack I purchased a couple weeks prior were corroded with battery acid seeping out.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Batteries did not last anywhere near the length of the Duracell that we purchased. Did a side by side test and the Amazon batteries were down to 50 to where the Duracell batteries were still at 99. Will do some more testing to make sure the test were equal. We bought two new trail cameras and we put one set of Amazon's batteries in one camera and one set of the duracell batteries in the other. We will now switch the batteries in the cameras for the same time frame and see what the end result is.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Some of the unused batteries stored in AC room show signs of deterioration within six months of purchase. Poor battery performance
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Trust Amazon Basics products. Work like the top name brand products, but at a greatly reduced price. Use these in my bike lights."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"You know, I really like the Amazon line of batteries. At first I has hesitant on using anything other than Duracell, I tried these and especially for the price you simply cannot go wrong...."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Battery replenishment
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,great price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Beautiful batteriesI put 3 of them in the Trimmer, it run like brand newI haven't heard its motor sound so powerful in more than a year"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Gave these batteries a shot, because we've had great luck with AmazonBasics products. I just purchased the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. These batteries do not last. I have a flashlight that uses 4 AAA batteries, and have gone through 8 batteries in a one week span. These die very quickly. I have had a similar experience with the AA batteries on a wireless Mac keyboard. Would not recommend these batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"i am ready to do a full review on this product.Sins the package arrived in my house, i immediately take 2 aa battery and put it to my mac mouse,believe me mac mouse is 24/7 in use and it got me thru for 1 month and 1 week FEB / 19 - MAR / 25-26really good product"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries for a awesome price. Could not ask for more.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great price and works fantastic
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries have a lot of power.My calculate acts like its on steroids.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Best Battery Deal! They last as long as Duracell and Energizer!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These test full charge while the ones i have been buying are already partially discharged bc u cannot tell how fresh they r, even when they are adv as good for 10 yrs."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Another great product from amazon. I also use their rechargeable AA batteries which last a lot longer than any Energizer or Duracell that I have ever used. When it comes to any common battery size (AA, AAA, C, D, etc.), I will only be using AmazonBasics. Give this product a try and you won't be disappointed. You can't beat the price and/or quality."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"great price for a quality product they last a long time and are useful, the package they come in is an excellent and convenient storage case that doesnt take up much space"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I go through a lot of double AA for my Xbox controller. I can't tell a difference with these compared to any brand. For the price, I'll stick with these."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,This is an amazing value. Very good batteries. Get some and stock up!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I have a 2 year old son who has plenty of toys that eat through batteries quickly, so I decided to try out this big pack. The batteries last a long time for low power items like tv remotes and audible toys. They run out of charge after a few days on my son's most used toy, a bubble machine. But, he does use it for long periods of time when he plays with it and it has a high power motor. I would say that higher prices batteries last a little longer with his high power toys, but the cheap price for these males up for that. I just added these to our subscription list and will buy the AAA of this brand when I need them."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries are the bomb. They work just as well as top brands (Energizer, Duracell) and are like half the price. They shipped super fast and there are so many that I still have some lying around from my order last year. Definitely will re-order when I run out. :)"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Would buy them again
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Best value ever! I have a toddler and almost all of his toys are AAA and these were a life saver! Thank god for AMAZON!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"It seemed like everything I bought for my daughter required 12 batteries a piece! This is a great value. Now all her swings, bouncers, and toys are fully operational. I've purchased this size and others. No issues and will buy all my batteries from Amazon from now on."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Such a great deal, this is a life saver! I am set for life(or at least for a few months)..I go through these like no other with my new automatic trash can"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,It's probably the best value for AA batteries out there. They function as expected.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Amazon never lets me down. These batteries are a great value. Cheaper than Sams club batteries and these are shipped to my house for free with Prime. They seem to last just as long as energizer batteries. They come packaged in a nice box and are wrapped in plastic. For all the toys we have that take batteries these are great.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I mainly use these in my xbox one cobtroller. I get an average of 2hrs longer life span compared to Duracell and for a fraction of the cost.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,they wear out to quickly. won't buy again. better off buying Duracell.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Seems to be equal to any other brand of batteries I have used.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,decent quality battery strength for price. better than dollar store for sure
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I used to use Duracells all the time, and then started having leakage problems with them. I ventured out to try these. Life seems to be as long in devices I use a lot, and they don't leak. I am done with Duracell, and will use these!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Arrived on time and works perfectly. Did not need this many but it was such a good price I couldn't pass it up.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,These batteries perform better than expected. I was very impressed.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries are lasting as long as my more expensive batteries. I bought them because I needed them for Christmas but, I will get these from now on."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Medical setting. Better than I thought they would be...Yes, perfect."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I am highly satisfied with these batteries. I mainly use them with Bose noise cancelling headphones and haven't experienced any issues. They last longer than most batteries I have purchases and are much cheaper than competitor brands. A well deserved 5 star rating!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Batteries have great life span. Highly recommend. They last just as long if not longer than the top name brands at a much cheaper cost.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I personally think that these batteries are as good as name brand ones for half the price! I primarily use these in my xbox one controllers and change batteries maybe twice a month of heavy play. Definitely worth the purchase!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I have used these for a while. I went thru a whole box but have not had to replace them yet in anything. Much better than the store brands at the large hardware chains.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I've been buying these for a couple of years. Totally indistinguishable from the expensive ones you get in the store. Great value. Never had an issue. Best bit is the packaging - it's an actual box you can close so you don't have batteries loose all around the place shorting themselves out. Also, they shrink wrap them in fours which add to the longevity of them."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,And I mean that as a compliment lol! I'm actually a long time user of the Sunbeam batteries from my local dollar store. I didn't feel like going out to get more of them this time so I ordered these instead. Looks like those will be my last dollar store batteries cause the AmazonBasics rock! I get the convenience of home delivery and they last about twenty percent longer. Thanks for a great product at a fantastic price Amazon.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I bought a big pack of the AAA batteries, but really didn't put them through the test until Hurricane Matthew. They worked awesome. Never had to change batteries in the lanterns after 5 days of heavy use (8-9 hours a day). Worked great in my son's toys, our remote controls, just everything. I know what brand I will buy from now on! Great job Amazon."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I have to admit these batteries work better than the name brand batteries. I rarely have to replace these batteries unless i'm using a remote control car or something that takes a lot of power. And for the price, you can't lose."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Better than the other brand names and definitely last longer in most applications. We buy and use them regularly and test them in our kids toys to make sure they stay at the top of their game and our expectations. Highly recommend.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"No joke, i was such a skeptic of these batteries. Seriously. But they seem more powerful than the name brand competition.I bought them for use in a breast pump mainly. I noticed with other batteries I was getting a lot less suction but with these it runs full power, just like I'd plugged it in the wall.I don't think I'll buy the name brand batteries anymore. Good job Amazon."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Long lasting and a great value! Come in very basic packaging, most likely to cut cost. Will buy again!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,tested these batteries along side name brand in a handheld microphone and they actually preformed better and lasted longer then the big name brands.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Low quality batteries - they die after using a few times. Better to go with big brand name
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Just as good as Duracell, if not better. Do you beg to differ Here is an experiment to conduct for a school child. Use a Duracell and an Amazon to light up two light bulbs and see how long each one stays lit. Then divide: (hours lit)/(cost of battery) and see which one is the better value. I already changed out one Amazon AA in my wireless mouse and another 2 AA batteries in my wireless weather station. The mouse Amazon AA lasted about a month and a half and the weather station is still running after 3 weeks. The batteries came wrapped in packs of 4."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"batteries are stupid expensive in the store. Everything seems to take AA batteries now (remotes, video game controllers, kids toys, etc), so buy in bulk online and save."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. If this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable brands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I have quickly become a fan of Amazon Basics products. You just can't beat the price and quality. These batteries run just as long as the Duracell's I had before this purchase. I bought these based on the reviews and because the price was so good. I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Wireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic wireless mice), TV remotes and clocks. So far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried. I keep them on a shelf in a rough room in my basement to keep them cool and dry. The do come wrapped in 4's in the box. That keeps them organized nicely in the box, but the wrapper can be a frustration so I keep a razor knife on the same shelf which make very quick work of that. Problem solved. Overall, I am totally satisfied and as I said, I will buying more of the Amazon Basics as they become available."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works just fine in my Xbox One controller. I replaced the batteries a few weeks ago and they're still fine.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These perform and last just as well as Energizer or Duracell. We burn through these at my office for wireless keyboards and mice, so I needed to restock at a good price. I've never had any complaints by anything made by AmazonBasics at all. These come in a simple cardboard box that's sealed. Inside that box, you have two rows of sealed/wrapped batteries. They worked great for my needs, and will return based on the price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Bought these for my sisters day care. She said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I've had my Thea for three months so far and it is amazing except for some recent issues. The problem is now it's breaking (after only three months) and I have no clue why. It won't charge anymore and it isn't vibrating on full power. I'm hoping that Nymph will send me a replacement considering the lifetime guarantee. I'm kind of upset at how fast it broke though, despite how good of a condition I tried to keep it in."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"For running on batteries, this light is super bright and works awesome. I have these all over my house and thwy work great. Easy to install and has a pretty decent battery life."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I purchased these a little more than skeptical about how long these would actually last. But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through. So I said why not and bought them. They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and gadgets require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surpised I was with these. They come in a card board box which is was nice and easy to store. The batteries are wrapped up into groups of 4's. They hold a fairly long charge so you don't have to change them out too often.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Work as well as major brands, as far as I can tell, but for a much better price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Obviously I have not tried all of the batteries in this pack, but now we are about half way through the pack and all of them have worked great and I have not had to replace any of them."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Decent batteries, I find they die a little quicker than others, but still fine for the price"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Capacity is a little light on these, but the price is awesome."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I don't know if these last any longer or shorter than other brands, but the price is good so we'll see how it goes over time."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I use them for Xbox one controllers, 2 batteries last maybe 2 weeks in my controller, but you get a good amount in the box. Might just look into rechargeable batteries. Tv remotes last longer obviously. 48 batteries for 12 was an easy sell though for me"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,I don't know how these batteries got such great reviews. They don't last nearly as long as the brand name batteries. Don't buy these unless you want to change batteries in your kids' toys and remote controls all the time. I'm super loyal to Amazon...but not with this product.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,great for the price but don't last long but the quantity makes up for it
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"These are low powered, don't last long even in tv remite you arelucky to get a week out of them. Energizer s last a year usually. Don't wasteyour money."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Not good. Don't last a week.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,I find they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries all had a charge of 1.61 volts when i received them,much more than the duracel brand. The exp. date on them is 12/2026. i would buy these again.....Can't go wrong with AMAZON !!!! They always please,one way or another ......"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great battery, last just as long, great price"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love these batteries! Cheap and every bit as good as the big brands!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I bought the large box because I use a lot of batteries and also purchased the set of four Everyday Essentials LED lanterns. Now, I will be prepared the next time the power goes off. What's to say about batteries I trusted Amazon contracted with a good battery manufacturer to produce them and carry their brand name. At about 25 cents each, you cannot do better."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Awesome purchase. Last a pretty long time!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,they are fresh batteries and work great
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good batteries at a cheap price.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,You cannot beat this price for how many batteries you get! I will be ordering these again!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I've usually had very good experiences buying AmazonBasics branded items. I've found them to very comparable to the top brand names. These batteries are the exception. Quality wise, they are more comparable to Rayovac batteries than Duracell or Energizer."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,A real pleasure.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"love amazon batteries..great quality, great price"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"You cannot beat the quality for the price of these batteries. For the same price as the cheapo brands, these AmazonBasics batteries are great quality. Nice weight to them compared to the cheap Sony or Sunbeam batteries. Performance wise they have been good so far and been using about a dozen of them for a month now."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Honestly, they are AAA batteries. I had a keyboard that only takes AAA and don't have rechargeable ones. So far, haven't had an issue. Whether or not they last as long as name brand is yet to be seen. But the fact that I bought these already a few months ago and I'm currently typing on said keyboard with the first set I took from package tells me they should last long enough."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"They are Super , had them in my outdoor weather station sensors for 10 months and in with all types of weather conditions and they are still working !!!!!!!!!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great deal on these batteries. They are a quality product! I'm not sure why anyone would spend more just to get a more recognized name brand. These AmazonBasics are great, last as long as the big name brands, and I like the way they come packed, too."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries and a really good price. So far I have been very impressed with the value you get when you buy any AmazonBasics item.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I bought a box of batteries to use in birthday and Christmas presents for the kids. You would never know these weren't big name batteries. They last just as long as the ones you'd buy at big box store, but cost so much less. I haven't used any yet that seemed to die long before they should have.The batteries come in a slim cardboard box which is easy for storing. My only complaint is that they are plastic wrapped in sets of 4 inside the cardboard. While this does make it easy if I have to grab some to take with me, it seems a tad environmentally unfriendly and the plastic is tightly wrapped, making it hard to open."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Got the juice, delivered right to the house, not a dud in the box."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,AmazonBasics never disappoints. These are good quality batteries at a much better price compared to Duracell which I think these are comparable too. A great deal for this HUGE pack!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries are top quality and you can't beat the price. If your in the market for batts then amazon basics are for you.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great option for all the little doo-dads and junk that doesn't need much power. I use these in TV remotes and such.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"It's batteries, you've used them. I keep these in my desk drawer specifically for my wireless Xbox 360 controller. Great price for the quantity, will be buying again in the future."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,Only 3 worked out of the entire pack.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The few batteries I have used so far work and are holding up. Will update if they fail prematurely
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I've been ordering these cheap batteries for years for my XBOX controllers. They are cheap and long lasting, and I'll never go back to picking up batteries at the store again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,cheap and work gritty good
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Well this is my second order of batteries thru Amazon and both the energizer and these are not as good as the ones from the store
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Batteries die quicker than Dollar store batteries. Used these batteries on various products -toothbrush, computer mouse, camera flash, etc. Batteries at best lasted half as much compared to Energizer and Duracell. Would not recommend!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,cheap battery power but they don't last well
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works just as well as any other batteries just much cheaper!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I love the package they came in, it makes it easy to store the extras."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries leak easily and I found them hard to insert into a toy that required AAA. Did not have this problem when I switched them with brand name batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Don't last as long as Duracell, but you can't beat the price"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Cheap, long lasting batteries. Can't beat it."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I bought these after discovering they were cheaper than any other brand I could buy in the store. I realized after several weeks that we were replacing batteries significantly less often after getting these.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I'm very happy with these batteries. Cheaper than a local deal at a hardware store. They seem to work as well as the name brands. I'm happy with the quality and quantity.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good batts
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Just as great as name-brand batteries! The only difference seems to be the labels.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"I'll keep this relatively brief. I use rechargeable, mainly Eneloop batteries for almost everything. Every once in awhile though I have something that doesn't need the more expensive batteries or are exposed to rougher conditions like remotes or outside hose timers where I just want something disposable. These work well for that. I would buy them again"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The price is cheaper that the other famous brands. It works just as great as the other ones. Since when Amazon started selling their brand's battery I am a fan1 of it. I buy AA and AAA. I truly recommend this brand.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Cheap price for your standard batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Comes in a box that is convenient for storing. High quality batteries and not high quality prices.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"This may seem silly, but probably the main reason I love these is that they come in a compact cardboard box that easily opens and closes. Sick of having batteries roll around in a drawer, I was trying to find a container. None seemed to be all that good. But, with these, you don't need it! Such a brilliant concept! I get so many things in cardboard boxes that I throw out. But batteries Whoever thought of this deserves a pay raise."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I've used Amazon batteries for a couple of years in everything from remotes, toys, flashlights, noise cancelling headsets, and portable games and have been very pleased. They have not let me down yet. The performance is comparable to what you get out of the leading major brands at a fraction of the price. You can save even more if you add these to your Subscribe Save items! You can't beet the price! I highly recommend them!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,great batteries for the price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I've used 4 of these batteries now and the life appears to be comparable with that of Duracell/Energizer. The cost savings over the mainstream brands makes these a real winner! Would buy again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These were purchased to add to our many battery operated Christmas decorations. They continue to perform as advertised.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,great price and now I have them on hand whenever I may need a battery!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Cheap and easy batteries in an easy open package that is also recyclable and good for storage. Perfect for those toys (child and adult toys) that are constantly using batteries. I wish Amazon offered a package with prepaid return postage for recycling. I would pay an extra dollar or something if I could pack them back in the box and ship them back to Amazon for recycling. YOU HEAR THAT AMAZON
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"LEDs run thru these so fast man. But, I'm lazy and amazon delivers so I keep buying them. Don't have a time sheet. But I have one of those harbour freight free with purchase lights and it seemed to last 5 hours before I noticed it was dim. So that's good I guess as its still very bright, just not new, never been used bright.Usually I replace 1 out the 3 batteries every 3 weeks. But I work on a bike and car, and have never had any LED go out or get unusable dim during a job with a fresh change."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,They seem to be lasting a while. They're batteries tho. So yeah. A convenience item for when you buy something else on here that needs batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far these batteries perform as well as any other alkaline battery that I have used. The cost even beats Duracell at Costco so I consider it a good deal.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Not really the greatest
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Amazon Basics. That's all that needs to be said:)
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don't waste your money.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These are the worst batteries i have ever bought. Two days in my remote for tv and replaced and 2 days later,dead. Im very dissappointed with you Amazon for selling this to me."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Love this when I'm doing my makeup. it was a lot larger than I expected which I really loved! The only con I found is that it is TOO BRIGHT. When I first used it, my eyes and head hurt because of the brightness. But overall, this is a great product."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These batteries die quickly!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"These batteries don't last as long as the top brands, but for the price I can't complain too much."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,decent batteries. doesnt seem to last as long as better brands. use it for xbox 1 controller.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,These are decent batteries for a pretty good price. I haven't experienced any leaking yet. Would buy again. Will update if there are problems.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Decent batteries for a great price, idk if they last as long as energizer but so far so good, I will order more for Christmas for sure."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Amazon Batteries! They got me on the price, but how's the performance! Honestly I can't tell cause who's counting I usually by pro cells because Sometimes I'm a pro. Just kidding but really i work in entertainment so we use pro cells but I bought a box of these just to keep handy and save the day when pro cells are not available. These really aren't that bad. Pro TIP: Make sure you dispose them properly so you don't kill the earth. I'd definitely buy these again. Now that I am a father, there's all kinda of other things to put batteries in. Also do not skimp out on your earthquake kit. It sounds like whatever but honestly you need to prepare folks!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Decent batteries price wise but don't seem to last as long as the name brand batteries and I assume these are actually some lower end name brand batteries that Amazon has their name stuck on them.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,They die pretty quick in certain items. But decent price. Nice packaging though. I'd probably buy again just for remotes smaller items.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Defective and cheap. Only a third held any charge and those died super fast.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I put two of these batteries in my wireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out. I will throw the rest of them away and NEVER buy these again.I know I'll never get my money back. I'll just write it off as a lesson learned."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"AAA batteries. They make things go. I, uh...I have nothing else. I mean, batteries are pretty much--Oh, wait! They're quite shiny also."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great deal!! Ive had no problems with these batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. ."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Ordered on accident when I had searched for RECHARGEABLE batteries. Not happy. I will be less free about ordering on Amazon from now on. My fault, but it made my put up my guard."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you'd be better off buying a quality brand."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,died quick
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,these batteries died very quickly when compared to energizer or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"the last time i had batteries go dead so soon were the ones i purchased at harbor freight.. i had to change the batteries in a comcast remote every 2 weels and in my digital camera , without the flash after 20 shots.."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Cheap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Amazn brand again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,Disappointed by the amount of time these batteries lasted.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Don't bother. The AA's I bought got remotes last a third as long as everready batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Worked for one day, then stopped working. Can't tell if it deterred any cats because it only went off when I walked by, but didn't register the cats when they jumped on the counter.Would not recommend."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These things do not last very long either in the product they are powering or on the shelf. The ones we had on our shelf were not even good to use after 4 months of sitting.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Additional info now a couple of months later... We were very disappointed in these batteries as they did not last long at all. We put one in a regular kitchen clock and within 1 week, the time was off by 20 minutes. Put them in a different clock, same results, time was off by 10 minutes within a few days, put them in a battery op shaver, which the other brands most of the time last at least a month, these lasted about a week. Even a small weather station about a week until the time was wrong. Got the 20 pack, not sure if it was a bad batch but we do not recommend these batteries and wont buy them again. Store brands and Rayovac last much longer. Original review below, still stands as easy opening but did edit to say how disappointed we are.Amazon basics AA batteries EASY OPEN packaging is FABULOUS, no cut fingers on sharp plastic packaging and no need for scissors, opened like a dream.... GREAT IDEA!!! Haven't had them long enough to see how long lasting they are."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These batteries do not last long at all as compared to Energizer. After 4 days of use they were no good anymore. The Energizer batteries have last me two weeks so far when using for the same thing. I will be using far more batteries so it really isn't a money saver. Disappointed!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Bought several times and they last
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Medium durability. Gonna buy Duracell in future. Do you have great quality rechargeables
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Because paying 20-40 dollars at Walmart (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right If you are like me and have 3 kids that all have annoying gizmos and electronic crap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer. I have not tested these with my joule thief to see how long they can last. But I'd say on par with the others.This may sound dorky-- when batteries are this cheap, you will find yourself putting them back into toys, remotes, electronics that you had previously marked as not necessary to be powered."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. What a disappointment. Threw them away. :(
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I've bought a lot of AmazonBasics batteries, and nearly all of them have been more than half dead on arrival. My remote controls won't even work with the brand new batteries in place. I won't be buying these again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,So far so good. Let's see how they hold up over time. Hope they hold their charge and don't leak.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Good quality for the low price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,They are ok batteries. I use them on my remotes and have to switch out frequently.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Great price, does the job. Used them to power BV Bicycle Light Set Super Bright 5 LED Headlight, 3 LED Taillight, Quick-Release. Gives very good light intensity, albeit first few uses. Can't yet vouch for how long these batteries last vs. Duracell."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,good price good batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These are batteries so what can one say. ...they are economical and function. I bought light motion that require 3 AAA batteries. I needed 9 and they all work flawlessly. Plus now my remote control also works too.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,It doesn't work with my Amazon wireless mouse
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Don't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These straight up don't work. I have put 6 different, brand new batteries from this pack into a controller and none of them have worked. Steer clear."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Why spend more on other brand name batteries when you can get these for a fraction of the price and they work really well.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Don't know why I waited so long to finally invest in rechargeable batteries. Once you switch, you won't go back!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,These are priced nice but don't last long
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Great deal price wise but don't seem to last very long at all. So really not a good deal at all. Would not buy again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,I like that these batteries are cheaper but they don't last as long as I'd like. We will continue to buy them though because of the price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Don't last quite as long, but DAMN, you can buy three times as many as leading batteries. For our office staff, very worth it."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energizer, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries don't last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The price point is what attracted me to these AA batteries. They last as long or longer than most other brands. We have several outdoor christmas decorations that use these and they performed great. AmazonBasics batteries are the best.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Disappointed... In my handheld Microsoft wireless game controller these last about 1 week. Duracell/Energizers last 3-4 weeks... Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Prime. Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell. DON'T PUT THESE IN ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE... like smoke detectors, emergency flashlights and radios."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Don't see any difference between energiser or duracell and a fraction of the cost. Go Amazon!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great value for batteries in bulk - our household expends batteries quickly, so it's great to always have a backup supply.The low cost of these means I can afford to keep plenty on hand. The quality is comparable to most other brands we've tried - especially for video game controllers and the like."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These batteries are supposed to be 1.5 volts. But I opened and tried to use them as soon as I got them and had problems.I checked the batteries and they only had 1.25 volts upon delivery and of course they are non returnable.Don't waste your money on these, go ahead and pay a little more and get the popular name brands."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Won't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detectors with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell. The last Duracell batteries lasted almost 3 years in the same detectors. Don't waste your money on these, spend a little more for a good product."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Awful. Bought these specifically for my very small milk frother, these batteries can barely power the thing! I used whatever name brand in the frother before this and it ran full blast. But with the Amazon batteries, it gets up to like medium speed and doesn't even last 1/2 as long. Will never buy Amazon batteries again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Very, very, very difficult to turn on and off, not sticky enough and kept falling down, complete waste of money.When I could get them on and they were sticking, the lighting effect was very nice however, the quality of the product was zero."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,The original Amazon Basics in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to recharge them and it leaked all over my battery charger. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. So if I were you, don't charge them"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Exactly what I needed, lots of AA batteries for a cheap price. They last just as long as any other battery so this was totally worth it. Will only buy my batteries from here now on."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I've used theses batteries in several devices now, and they always run out of juice much faster than typical AA batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I've only found 2 out of the box that have lasted longer than a week!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Drains Fast... Item just as described....
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,Not very long lasting batteries....

I am often surprised when I change batteries in a high-use device and realize how long these batteries last. They also have a nice look and when you buy a brick of them they are conveniently wrapped in bundles of 4, which makes for easy storage. They wont replace Duracell's in my high-power-drain equipment, but for everything else these are great."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These work just as expected and offer great bang for your buck.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Happy with my purchase of the 48-pack of size AA. As with all batteries, I check the expiration dates before opening. I got these in October 2016, and they will remain excellent up to March 2026. There is no way I can buy these locally at this price unless I go to a Dollar Store and buy already-expired or close-to expiring dates. I need these to replenish my emergency supplies. These came in one box, six sets of four wrapped together. (Edited to correct dates)"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Went cheap...got cheap. DO NOT BUY. Went to pack for an upcoming trip and noticed brown stuff all over. I was storing the batteries in a separate case (which is now ruined). Thank goodness this wasn't in any if my expensive scuba or camera equipment. Never had other brands do this. Always store batteries outside of equipment anyways. Totally bummed. Shame on you Amazon. Get out of the battery business. I buy A LOT on Amazon... ALOT, but no more batteries."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel.

The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Best buy for batteries! You'd think I'd never run out...and I don't with this great pack! Better than name brand.... Oh...wait...Amazon Basics is NAME BRAND!! Definitely recommend!

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These seem as good as top-tier brands and models.Using these on professional audio equipment... the equipment ran the same amount of time.I think the only difference, is they are vastly less expensive."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Am amazed at how well I'm loving your batteries, Amazom. I have been a loyal Duracell buyer, but find yours are not cost way less, but last longer. Would give them 10 stars if you allowed me."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,you always need AA batteries very good
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,You can't beat the price! Lasts as long if not longer than national brands! This is my second order!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,You can't go wrong with this many batteries at this price!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,You have no idea how badly we needed affordable batteries in our house! Thank you.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,For the price you can't beat these. I have never had any issues with them. They last long and work well.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,When using these batteries in a professional camera flash (high powered device) they last only 3/4 as long as a similar duracell or energizer battery but for the difference in price I recommend these. In something like an xbox controller (low power device) they seem to last just as long.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"It's not a high discharge battery, but for typical uses such wireless mouse and flashlights, these are great."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Why pay extra for Duracell batteries when AmazonBasics' batteries will last almost as long I bought a 48-pack of AA batteries for just 12 that's just 25 cents per battery! Meanwhile, Energizer Max was being sold at 14 for a 24-pack, coming out to 58 cents per battery and Duracell Coppertop was being sold at 12 for a 24-pack, coming out to 50 cents per battery. Amazon has proved the quality of its items over and over again, but I'd say they really outdid themselves this time. Ask anyone which battery brand is the best and most will answer Duracell, while some others may answer Energizer. That's because both companies, particularly Duracell, have built a solid, positive reputation as long lasting batteries, and not only do they last long, but they also survive a long period of time being stored. Some Duracell batteries even state that they'll last 10 years without being used, of which I have no doubt if any battery can last that long, it's Duracell. Nonetheless, Amazon has also created a battery that outshines most, and in most applications even outshines Duracell and Energizer. AmazonBasics batteries last a long time before having to be replaced and they come at a cheaper price than what you'll find in the dollar store, plus they look pretty cool. Obviously that last part isn't important, but it's nice to have a unique-looking battery that can be easily distinguished from all others. AmazonBasics also claims that their batteries have anti-leakage protection and can be stored for up to 10 years, just like Duracell. All three brands offer anti-leakage batteries, AmazonBasics and Duracell batteries are said to last up to 10 years in storage, and Energizer offers batteries that last up to 20 years in storage. If you want to store batteries for a decade or two, your best bet is Energizer Ultimate Lithium. If you are using batteries for important applications such as smoke detectors, although I suspect that AmazonBasics would fulfill its job, maybe stick with Duracell just because it has already proven over a long period of time the quality and consistency of its products, while AmazonBasics is still creating its name. But for pretty much everything else, from remote controls to cameras to calculators and everything similar, AmazonBasics should be your only thought when it comes to buying batteries.Here are links for what I believe are each brand's best batteries:AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack)Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA Batteries, World's Highest-Energy AA Battery, 8 countDuracell Ultra Power Aa Batteries 8 Count"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Found these here before Christmas, and decided to order for our children's toys that required batteries. Can't beat the price for the amount you get, they work as expected, and long lasting. In my opinion the box they come in is extremely convenient compared to other battery packaging."

For the price, I also just got some of these color window candles and the Amazon batteries are working as they should. I honestly don't mind the cost of batteries so much when compared to the brand name batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Good solid batteries at a good price. They dont last as long as the full retail name brands which means you do need to change them more often but overall still a money saver in the long run.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Good batteries for a good price. I just got them before Christmas, and I used them in battery operated lights.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Good batteries for the price, they last a decent amount of time like other major brands. These came in handy near Christmas time with all the toys Santa brought. They are packaged in groups of 4 and I like how they have a container (cardboard box with cover) to keep them stored. I would definitely buy them again.they are NOT rechargeable and for some reason I thought they were when I bought them....had a brain fart or something. Good batteries overall regardless."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"For the price these batteries works as good as name branded batteries. I would compare these to Ray-O-Vac, but NOT Duracell!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Batteries are good, duracell might last just a tad bit longer but the price difference is not worth the extra . Kind of hard to review a batteries, but the packaging was easy to open and the batteries were neatly packaged."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"When I ran out of AA batteries, I of course came to Amazon to purchase more. As I am on a tight budget, I decided to go with the AmazonBasics brand. When they arrived, I immediately replaced the batteries in my Xbox controller. I noticed that the batteries did not last as long as the more popular name brands. (i.e. Duracell, Energizer, etc.) This is the only reason I have rated the product with 4 stars instead of 5. Everything else about these batteries is great. I am getting low already and will probably order them again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Works great, packaging was convenient too."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These seem to be a pretty decent AA battery. I can't find any faults with their life span.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I can't buy enough of these batteries. I bought but the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. I always buy batteries around Christmas for all the toys and devices everyone gets. This year was no exception for batteries. The only thing that surprised me was that this was the first year I needed more AAA then AA batteries. As the year continues to have more demand for batteries and try to keep a good stock in case of emergencies. The AmazonBasics batteries have been working great. They last as long if not longer than the other brands and they cost less. Even coupon clipping and waiting for sales hasn't beaten the price Amazon has been offering. I have made a number of purchases for Amazon batteries already and will continue to make more purchases in the future especially around Christmas again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great batteries for the price. I use them in Luna candles all the time. I leave the candles on all evening and night, so I keep a good amount of AAA batteries because I love my candles being different colors.. Keeping them on about 7-10 hours and they are a good battery."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries do the job for which they are intended. They power the grandchildren's gadgets as expected and are reasonably priced. I like how I can order in large quantities so there are plenty of batteries on hand when needed. My experience has been that these batteries last as long as the more expensive brand name batteries available at the big box stores. I have bought these batteries multiple times and will purchase again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Have had good success with these and the Amazon Basics AA's as well. They come in a cardboard box, in sets of two which is handy to grab, although I still wish they were not plastic wrapped at all. That said it is far easier and takes up less space than the typical packaging from other brands.Battery life seems fine with these as it did for AA (I had less success with the Amazon Basics 9v which had a horrible battery life)."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Pretty much the best price i've seen for AA alkaline batts. I use them for flashlights and also for radios. They come packaged in a nice simple cardboard box and not blister pack.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,As described

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Best price I have found for this amount of batteries anywhere. Good life on them as well.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,It serves its purpose.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These are basic AA batteries that get the job done. They may be cheaper than Duracell or energizer but they do not last as long in my experience. So you must decide if you prefer quality over price... I would buy these again because they are good enough for me. Much like most of the amazon basics product line, these hold up and if there's an issue, amazon will let you return them."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"As a rule, it's hard to tell the difference between one alkaline battery and another. Pull the Duracells out, and put in Everyready Alkaline Energizer, and you won't notice any difference in performance. Fifty years ago, freshness was a big factor, but alkaline has a long shelf life. These alkaline AAs are indistinguishable from most brands.In a way, that's a shame. The copper-top Duracells make it easy to avoid putting in new batteries upside down.On the other hand, the packaging excels. Instead of a brick of loose batteries, sets of 4 batteries are shrunk together, making it easier to avoid loosing loose batteries, without consuming the space that the big cards with their bubbles consume. The 4-packs are in a corrugated cardboard box that looks llike it will last long enough for the purpose.These are enougfh batteries here to last me a long while. I'll be needing AAA batteries soon, though, so I'll order them in a month or two."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"These are good if you're broke and just need to get by. They work, but like other reviewers are saying, they don't last as long as other brands or rechargeable batteries.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Don't last as long as energizer but a great deal!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,They're cheap for a reason - they don't last nearly as long as Energizer or Duracell's from what I've noticed.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Nice price and works well.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,This is as good of a glove as you will find for the money. Be aware the when ordering they are extremely small if you normally wear a large an extra large will still be tight and need some break in time. Order at least one size bigger
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"so far they are work well, however have had them long enough to determine if how long they last compared to duracell batteries."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good long lasting batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their 2A batteries. The 2A batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaked and were stuck together. Making it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good pics.we will see how long that last..

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good--and no problems anticipated!I really like the packaging--groups of 4 in plastic wrappers makes them easy to maintain in the package.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Lasts long, good price, and keeps my kids toys running."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"I purchased these AmazonBasics batteries because I used a lot of batteries around the house and I was looking for the best value. I would say the convenience factor is there: I can stock up on these and I don't have to run to the store to pick up batteries. Compared to the Rayovac brand, which I have been using exclusively before purchasing these, I would say the AmazonBasics batteries give you just a bit less life. They do store well and perform well in most electronics that I've tested thus far."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Perfect, great price, love it!"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Good products. I like the Amazon batteries. The only reason they didn't get 4 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand. As the battery ages, it gets weaker. It lasts about as long as a normal Duracell or Energizer, but the output drops significantly as the product ages. They are great for remote controls, smoke detectors, etc. Not advisable for anything with moving parts or motors."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Amazon Basics is great, the batteries last as long as other alkaline batteries and the price is terrific."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great product at great price. Last just as long as ones I buy from store. With having young kids these are well worth it

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good product. Perfect when you have kids and they think batteries are free in the store. Good alternative for Duracel.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Haven't conducted any testing so I'm not absolutely sure about how these compare for performance to Duracell, Energizer or Ray-O-Vac. Gut feeling is that they are about the same as Energizer and Ray-O-Vac in performance and I can sometimes get Ray-O-Vacs on sale at Home Depot/Lowes for a competitive price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Batteries seem to last a good amount of time and I received all of them in this pack unlike the AAA pack I bought from Amazon which was missing four batteries.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I bought these to use in my Xbox one and 360 controllers. These batteries are great but then again 2 batteries might last 3 nights, the next set you put in might die in the same night or they might last for a entire week. These seem to be doing better than the rayovaks."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I tested these by putting them in my sons jumper. That little boy really goes at it on that thing and we run through batteries like its nothing. Its been almost two hours (I put it on the music setting where it goes constantly and isn't based on his motion) and the songs are still playing without sounding distorted. A little pricey for being online and from amazon itself but all in all good.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Lo cost for long lasting batteries.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"As of this writing, I've been using these for over a year and have yet to experience any problems or issues related to dead batteries or battery life.I use a battery tester, and randomly measured a few, new, out of the box, and they all rated at 100. Happy with these batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries at a great price!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I've seen these batteries on amazon, but was uncertain as to their quality.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"they work well so far, cheaper than other batteries i have seen. hoping there wont be any leakage or anything."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Good so far. I've not done extensive testing, but these seem adequate and the price is right. Definitely better than some other store brand batteries (Bass Pro Shops I'm looking at you) I've tried. They seem on par with major brand batteries to me, but that's a completely subjective evaluation."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These work very well but took longer than expected for deliveryl

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Work great for me.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Good batteries, and better value then what is found in stores."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Package of batteries came in Amazon shipping box measuring 13 x 9.75 x 3 . Inside that box with bubble wrap was a smaller cardboard box measuring 5.75 x 6.128 x .75. The batteries came in two cellophane wraps, 20 batteries in all 10 per wrapper.The AAA batteries measure 10.22mm in diameter and 44.22mm in length. Battery imprinted with Amazon basis. The battery is mostly silver accented with a green circle with a check mark inside. One of the ends of the battery has a little protruding button and is marked with a + sign. The other side of the battery is flat and marked with a minus sign. There are several descriptions and warnings printed on the battery. One of the messages with a black background states No mercury added with a note below that says Made in Indonesia with some more writing that looks like French. Also printed on the battery is a note reading ALKALINE BATTERY and below this, AAA/LR03/AM4 followed by 1.5V. There is some Chinese symbols as well. Another warning reads- May explode or leak if recharged, disposed of in fire, short circuited, or improperly inserted. Again this is followed with French writing. Also there are other warning labels, one with a small circle that has a line thru it, a small picture of a garbage can with a line thru it, and another small circle with arrows around a E.The battery fits in my small flashlight and powers up ok, but has not been in there long enough to test the longevity of the battery. Seems like a good value per battery if they last a while. I would purchase these again if they prove to last a reasonable time."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I bought this pack of 36 Amazon Basic batteries for my 2 great-grand-children's Barbie doll and for a drone. It was part of their Christmas presents to go with the doll and the drone. Knowing the kids and how much they loved their Christmas gifts I knew that they were going to go through a lot of batteries--so I had to get a big pack. I can't speak about how long these batteries will stay charged as they just got them and also, I live over 100 miles from them and don't see them often. I will update this the next time I see them and let you know how long these batteries lasted. But for the money as many as you get, I considered this a good deal."

Packaging is very simple to get open, and since ordering the first pack, I've yet to replace a single one. I'd wager they will last just as along as name-brand ones we'd been purchasing for years. Will update my review if anything changes.In short, the high praise + reviews for these batteries are the real deal. Will certainly be back for more when our stock runs low...."

I really do not like battery price shopping all the time and this makes it so easy! I hope that helps! ray333ray2001yahoo.com

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These are just as good as any battery you'll buy in your big box store. ..I have two boys who love gaming and rc vehicles and we go through batteries like crazy. The price is awesome for 48 batteries, and I don't hear Mom, are we out of batteries every three days!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"We got these inexpensive batteries for battery-operated candles for our wedding centerpieces. We didn't expect them to be the best batteries, but we only needed them to work for a few hours so we figured we would give these a shot. The batteries, as it turns out, work great. They kept our centerpieces lit throughout the ceremony and reception and didn't fade a bit. We are still using them around the house and they've been fantastic. I'll never shell out my hard-earned money for Duracel or Energizer again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"We purchased the Amazon Basics batteries mainly for the price and shipping speed and love them.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I think this is a great price for 48 batteries. If you are anything like me, i have never have batteries when I need them! Usually its the remote control, and I either borrow batteries from a different device, or switch the batteries around in the remote(which I may add does work very short term, but it does work!) When I saw these on Amazon I couldn't pass them up. We bought these in October, which was super helpful around Christmas. They come in a nice sturdy box, which is where I store them. They are packages in groups of four. They have lasted a while, and I have had no issues.I paid around 11 then and I just noticed that they are slightly cheaper with Subscribe and Save so needless to say I will be picking up another box. Great Batteries!"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great batteries! No need to pay 2 or 3 times this price for a name brand! I use these in the kids toys, remote controls, etc. I would only spend the money on a better battery on a critical tool, flashlight, etc. The way my kids use batteries in their toys, this is the route to go! They last just as long as the comparable name brand and come in much easier packaging!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Overall, great product, fast shipping, great service experience. Only reason I am rating 4 stars is the battery life seems less than the Duracells I used to use but I believe these are better overall value (significantly cheaper per battery) thus, this product certainly met my expectations but did not necessarily exceed them."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love these batteries and last just as long as the top name brand batteries. Amazon will be the place I order all of my batteries from. Great dependable batteries. Love ordering in bulk and having spares.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Really good batteries. Use them in my new LED flashlights. Last a long time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,They are AA batteries. They work. I'm not a professional evaluator but these seem to be at least as good as the duracell or energizer batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"They're batteries, what can I say They work! Seem to last a fair amount of time, better than the average bear!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"What more could you ask for, Amazon sure makes it easy to get what you need when you need it. I was just digging through the junk draw when I realized I was completely out of both AAA and AA batteries. Amazon to the rescue. Two minutes later batteries ordered and on the way. Almost everything I normally use on a daily basis (or remember using) has built in rechargeable batteries, that is until I start thinking about remotes and game controllers, the little things that are just apart of my life without actually being memorable. Well that is while they work, I remember them when they don't work. This pack of batteries last me about a year (I think, just a guess) which is perfect. I tore the top of the box and threw the entire container in the front of my junk draw. I like how the container is just cardboard, not horrible formed plastic like the last pack of batteries I had. They are also separated into three vertical partitions of 4 sets of 4 batteries wrapped in plastic. Some may find this inconvenient with the extra steps of removing the extra wrapping. I like it, I usually need batteries in pairs of 2 or groups of 4, so i can just quickly unwrap a pack and go to town. This also makes it easier to clean up if I drop the box."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I use AA's a lot and have gone to rechargeable's for most things but there are some applications that you need just regular Alkaline's.I bought the big 48 back based on the previous reviews and the value of the bulk pack.I've used these in several applications from trail cams to flashlights and have been very satisfied and find they last at least as long at the Gold colored ones you buy at a much higher price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,great battery work great last long time
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"great price, lasts a long time too"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I keep reading how people theorize the energy usage of these batteries in comparison to the name brands. I can say that in high use devices such as flashlights, they do drain faster than Duracell. However when compared to the cost, you will still come out ahead with these, at least when buying in bulk.In addition I found that Duracell batteries gave me 4 weeks with the candles I own while Rayovac gave me 3 weeks. These Amazon batteries give me 6 weeks. So they are not only a better price but longer lasting as far as slow power drain devices.I have been using these batteries now for a great deal of time and with applicable use not pretty but utterly useless conjecture. Numbers and potential usage reports look all fine and dandy but are nothing compared to having purchased and used at least half a thousand of them. I love em. They work great in my nearly 100 electric candles."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries at an unbelievable price. Will definitely purchase more.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"They are batteries, they are cheap, and they work.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"The arrived as described and all seem to work great! They were the best price of all the batteries, but are a quality battery."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great battery! Works better than Duracell on my garbage can.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I like the battery and the saving. It seems it doesn't last longer compared to other popular brand. I don't mind changing battery after paying 4 time less than a popular brand
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I am starting to think my teenage daughter eats AA batteries for extra energy. If you need bulk batteries, the Amazon batteries can not be beat."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Work as expected. Great buy.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I have been buying only amazon batteries for months and I am completely sold on them. I have had zero issues with them and they seem to work just as long if not longer than any of the high dollar manufactures you'll find in any store. I run them in everything from high drainage RC cars to led flashlights. I have used them in bubble machines for my daughters birthday party and the batteries were soaked with water and bubble mix. the batteries continued to function without issue. Great buy and good longevity
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Nicely packaged in a very sturdy rectangular cardboard box that serves to store the batteries. Started installing the fresh batteries in my devices the moment I received them, beginning with a thermostat and two remotes. Still have 42 to use and share. My only quibble is that I would have liked to find a 24- or at least 36-battery AmazonBasics package offering. I hope these alkalines stay strong in storage."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"last longer then maxell batteries and dont get near as hot when in heavy use as other batteriessize normal AA size.material good aluminum and Alkaline.quality great don't get to hot in full use and last a lot longer then others iv tested.pro's long lasting, don't get to hot, good materials.con's noneoverall great batteries great quality great bargainwould buy again yes they seam to be great batteries use in all devices like flashlights, cameras, remotes, ext also get a lot for the price"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good batteries at a good price!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"These batteries are a great buy, pretty much can't be beat for the price to quality ratio. I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Packaged well, comparable to duracell or energizer...they work just as well for a fraction of the price so all and all a good buy and will be ordering more when needed......"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries work just as well as the name brand batteries and they last just as long at a much better price point. I purchased these for the company, but I was so impressed with them that I purchased these batteries in AAA, AA and D on my personal Amazon account for home use and paid the same for a bulk package of 48 as I would have for an 8 pack of name brand batteries. They come in a sturdy cardboard box that comes in handy for neatly storing them. Amazon also printed the size of the batteries on the side of the box, making it easy to just grab the ones you need. Never again will we be asking each other if we have any (insert size) batteries and if so, where are they...or even worse, having to borrow a battery from one device to work another!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I am a Duracell fan. I am one of those types who uses a volt meter to test batteries prior to installation and often when I remove them I test them to see what is left at the end of its useful life. Duracell batteries are usually a good bit higher in their new state then any other battery I have used on average. They also seem to go for longer life cycles then any other battery and go lower as far as discharge voltage goes. These batteries are the first and only ones that seem to be close to Duracell. These are a better deal as far as price per unit goes. The difference in performance is not enough to pay more for Duracell batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These are cheap and work as well as name brand batteries.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Such a great deal for a LOT of batteries! It's always nice to have so many on hand. You never know when you're going to need them. Haven't noticed if the life is shorter than brand names. So far so good!

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,this work great so far! Such a great prices I was waiting for them to fail but so far they are working like powerful batteries should!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"when I was a kid we never had batteries, as an adult I dont let that happen. great deal."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These are the best most economical batteries you can get for low volume consumption items (which is 90 of what we use these days). I've used dozens of these and never had an issue with corrosion are leaking. Used mostly in remotes, toys, flashlights and general household items. Excellent bargain. Now we need to get Amazon to provide recycling as well!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I found the electrons in this brand of battery to be more uppity than in other brands. They get jiggy wi' it.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,They're batteries. They batter well. Great even.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Best everyday price I have found for high quality AA batteries. I only ever used national brand or Kirkland batteries in the past. These are just as good, at a better everyday price. Yes, I have found batteries on sale to be cheaper, but you have to catch the sale. However, I never seem to run out of batteries when there is a sale. So I stock up on these."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works ok. Doesn't last too long
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"For the price, I really can't complain. The life of the battery seemed comparable to other generic batteries. Great for remotes and other low use items. However, my son put these in a small indoor remote controlled helicopter and it chewed through them pretty quickly (which I expected). Again, good for the price and the right usage."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Decent longevity in electronics we use daily. In remotes they're fabulous, less so in more demanding electronics like games, cameras, and the half dozen Thomas trains my son loves. For the price in comparison to Duracell or Energizer you can't go wrong."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Great value for kid's toys, but they don't have the longevity of Duracells by any stretch. Definitely worth buying if you need a lot of batteries for cheap to top off all the noisemakers and remotes in your house, but I wouldn't throw them in flashlights or other higher-drain devices."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Good

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,great item
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries work great! They're not quite as good as Energizer or Duracell but they are a close second when it comes to the life you get out of them.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries work very well and come packaged extremely durably. I am very happy with this purchase.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great performance, better price. I don't feel like I'm buying cheap, I feel like I'm buying name brands batteries that are relabeled. They work great."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Very good performance and long lasting at a better than the dollar store price. I use AmazonBasics in a laser pointer at least twice daily for about twenty minutes a day. My dog is high energy and we live in an area where the weather is yucky and inclement. Yes, I know you aren't supposed to use a laser with dogs (I found that out 2 years too late). But that is the only way my dog can get enough exercise and not drive me crazy. I use to good through batteries like crazy. That being said, I have tried the better brands and AmazonBasics batteries and these seem to be superior in duration and very affordable."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"We got these because they were inexpensive and we wanted to have plenty on hand for our Christmas window candles that have a timer. I bought the big box because I thought since they were so cheap, we'd have to replace them partway through the season. I'm pleased to say that the original set of batteries I put in the candles at the start of the Christmas season, about 6 weeks ago for us, are still going strong!"

I also use them in the air freshener canisters, I'm in rescue and have these fresheners in every room. People who come for the first time are amazed that my home smells so good.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Bought these to go along with my Bose QC25, as they require 1 AAA battery. Have found these to last as well as any other major brand AAA battery in the context of these headphones, so am very happy!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"The toy companies and the battery making companies have a long running conspiracy to make you buy millions of batteries for your kids' toys. Thanks to Amazon, I can break the cycle of the evil conspiracy and just buy these cheap but long lasting batteries! Thanks Amazon for helping me stick it to the man."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries work well and at a much better price than you'd pay for quality anywhere else.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries are a great value for the price. They work just as well as the known brands like the bunny version. I like that I can get them from Amazon and don't have to remember when I am in the store. This comes in real handy around Christmas time when I am ordering gifts and always seem to need batteries. Thanks Amazon for helping out with my budget.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Bought these for various electronics and so far so good. I use to buy Procells but they seem to not last as long and I wanted to try something different. Amazon seems to make good generic products and I'm happy with these batteries so far.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Can't beat the value here.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I thought that I would give them a try, and I am surprised that these batteries seem to hold up as well as the 'ole copper tops--a great value. I have now bought my second package of these batteries, because I still like them better than anything else that I have tried. Price, value, and quality considered."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great value for the money! Long lasting used for my battery operated candles that were on at least 10 hrs a day and never had to replace my batteries during the Christmas season.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,GREAT VALUE!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries are first rate and fresh. Great Value for the price!

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Last just as long as any other battery. Great value for the purchase.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"After reading all the reviews for the batteries I decided it was worth trying since it as a great price for 48 batteries. Our family does through AA batteries like crazy. So as long as they last- I'm happy. I do see though that in electronics toys the battery doesn drain faster then in kitchen gadgets. But again,in my opinion it's still worth buying these batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Can't go wrong with a good value on high quality batteries. I love AmazonBasics for helping me save money. Batteries are great quality and price!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I've been purchasing various sizes of these AmazonBasics batteries for a while now, they're a great value in comparison to other brands. We are often using these in fairly mundane ways---remote controls, small flashlights, toys---but have also had success with them in game controllers that commonly drain batteries really quickly.One bonus with these AAs: they are shrink-wrapped 4 to a pack within the larger box. This makes it really convenient to toss a 4-pack in a purse, backpack, or glove compartment: no loose batteries rolling all around, and you know all 4 are the same age when you pop open the plastic wrap."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These are great value and I see no difference between the big name brands. I will be ordering more for sure.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I have a point and shoot camera that is a battery guzzler. I went on a 10 day trip abroad, and bought this pack of batteries. Either my camera wasn't as big a guzzler of energy, I didn't take enough pictures, OR these batteries are fantastic. In any case, I only went through three sets of four, for a total of 12 batteries. I have a huge reserve left for future picture taking. Did I mention they are at a great price I will definitely forego the grocery store and shop these batteries in the future."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Just as good as the top brands, but cheaper. Nothing more to say."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"A great buy for consumable, everyday batteries!RayB"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Great price and with a name like Amazon I feel these are going to be good. I bought for my daughter because I gave her something that she needed 27 (yes!) batteries for. Great value and plan on getting again if they work like I think they will. Only a 4 star rating because I don't know how long they'll last. So far so good
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great value!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I'm shocked at how long these cheap batteries last (mainly in LED candles). Great for items that don't use a lot of energy.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,They seem to last as long as name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"We love Amazon brand batteries. I feel like they are very comparable to the other name brands that are out there. We use these in our trail cameras, GPS systems, and around the home in the TV remotes, electronics, etc and I don't feel like I've had to change them any sooner than other batteries that we have. I think these are a GREAT value for your money and love that we can get these as apart of the subscribe and save program. I never have to worry about running out ever again!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Work as well as any other battery...IMHO!

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,As advertised. Is what it is. Great value.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great Value!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Is it just me, or is it a huge challenge keeping enough batteries on hand. It's easy just to order a bulk box of these rather than take a beating at retail price. I'm not sure they are up to Energizer or Duracell standards, but they do the job ok. No complaints so far."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,These batteries are awesome for kids toys that don't have moving parts and only music. Also works great in remotes and things like that. Great value for what you get. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,great value. Will have to see if they last as long as name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,They have all worked so far.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I use these for remotes, and Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers, even after I get a low battery warning they still work a VERY long time and I can not tell any difference between these and more expensive brands. I will be buying more of these and possibly moving over to the rechargeable ones."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Just as good as the name brand batteries for a better price!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love Amazon brand anything - had no idea they did batteries too! What can I say they're batteries! They seem to last a long time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love these compared to the big brands. I have these on hand at all times. They seem to last just as long as the more expensive options. Buying in bulk just pays for itself in convenience IMO.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far no issues. They're great batteries. They're such a good deal that after I got these I replaced the batteries in every device I own that uses batteries (to avoid old batteries corroding and destroying anything). So far dozens of devices (from flashlights to remotes) have been working perfectly. Very happy!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Thank you
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These are great! work just as good as the expensive name brand

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"fantastic batteries as good as if not even better than the name brand batteries. With a four year old that 90 of toys need a battery, these are a life and money saver."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love amazon batteries. Lasts just as long as Durecell or Enegizer or any other name brand but are half the price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,they dont last as long as the higher end rechargeable do or the regular batts do. I would say about half the time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,great price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Seems to work well I haven't been using them long, but have not had any problems"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,have you ever needed some double A batteries well look no further!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These seem to work well. Haven't used them for too long but they were a good price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries are awesome for the price. I actually did a weight comparison and they were very comparable to Duracell or Energizer. (Go grab a cheapo battery and compare that weight to a Duracell or Energizer battery... there is a significant weight difference.)
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Yea. Batteries. What can ya say. Ya can't miss with AmazonBasics.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Another way Amazon makes my life easier!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great batteries, just as good as Duracell if not better for a SWEEEEEEEEET price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,High quality batteries at an excellent price. Will buy again when needed.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These have worked wonderfully for me. The price is right, and they're at least as reliable as any other brand I've tried. I'll be reordering for sure."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These last the longest
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I get as good or better performance with these batteries as I do with any name brand batteries, but these are far less expensive, even compared to bulk packages in stores. I use a lot of batteries, so these were a great find! I love that the batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of four, thus making it easy to carry back-up batteries on-the-go. I have purchased these multiple times and will purchase again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries work just a well as the name brand batteries. I have purchased these in many different sizes and have nothing but good things to report. Save yourself some money and try these. I recommend them.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Just as good as Duracell. Would highly recommend for anyone living on a budget.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"It's a bargain! Works just as well as regular, higher priced batteries for a fraction of a cost. Highly recommend!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries at a great price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great Value!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked polarity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) So it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon AA with no problems."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Unfortunately, some of the batteries seem to be duds. I have replaced dead batteries with these, only to still have a dead remote. Great price, but I now know why..."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I didn't have any issues with these batteries dying on me but I am hesitant to make them a staple since it seems like there are others who have gotten bad batches. I will wait it out to buy again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the AA and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,What a deal! And finally I will not run out of batteries! What a great idea... a 100 of them!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,got it because of reviews. I really can't say they are any better than any other cheaper or more expensive brand. how can you rate it or check it. when your remotes stop working you put in new batteries.simple as that.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I absolutely love Amazon Spring end I never have any complaints they always stand behind their products although it's never needed because their products are normally made very well with quality materials I only buy my batteries off Amazon no I will not pay the price in the store as I find Amazon's batteries last approximately the same as like Energizer or Duracell and thieves Amazon basic brand batteries are probably half that price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I am a professional photographer and have these as backup for flash. kids steal them for their gaming.. they work and last the same as every name brand.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I am satisfied the batteries I recieved are just as good as any other name brand batteries that you could buy.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Amazon Basics. I am so glad these are part of the basics. I love these batteries. I get equal or better performance as you might expect from Duracel or Energizer. The benefit is that I pay less. Every single time I walk past batteries in a store I think, Amazon Basics and then like Vector from Despicable Me, I can hear, Oh YEAH!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I needed batteries and after having read and seen so many positive reviews I bought my first batch of Amazon Basics batteries. I was an Energizer girl and was very skeptical of trying another brand as other attempts proved unworthy. I am very pleased by the quality endurance of these batteries! I started with AAA and they worked so well that I bought AA when I needed more. The price can't be beat either! These batteries serve their purpose well and last a long time - the best bang for the buck that I have found!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I bought the batteries because of good reviews. I checked the voltage on several of the batteries, and they were fine. I have not had the batteries in use long enough to comment further."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,The batteries work but not well or for long for anything that requires a lot of power. I bought these for flame-less candles and they are perfect for that. But when I tried to use them in a child's toy they batteries died very quickly.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,GREAT BATTERIES and even Better PRICE!!!I will definitely order more when I run out.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,You can never go wrong with Inexpensive batteries that are delivered right to your door and last just as long if not longer than the national brands. From cameras to flash lights and toys these batteries last the test of time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Since I have bought these batteries, I do not feel like I am changing batteries as often as I were before using Rayovak. I will say however they do not last more than a couple days of hard play on the XBOX one controllers."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they definently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I should be a better citizen of the environment and use rechargeable batteries. I should, but I am not doing that. Instead, I'm buying the disposable ones like it's still 1985. If you're like me and are lazy and stupid, these will serve you well. Good value, standard batteries, etc etc. They aren't saving the earth or anything, but they are good functional batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I purchased these batteries because of the price and the backing of Amazon. I figured Amazon wouldn't put their name on a poor product. I used 12 of these batteries in an application and all 12 failed within a few days. Other batteries lasted months. For now I'll stay away from this product and fork out a few more bucks for a battery from a main stream manufacturer.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I found these batteries great, shipped on time, as advertized, good expiration dates, well packaged. I am puzzled by Amazon's refusing to ship more while investing what it claims are reports of problems. The reviews show overwhelmingly postive responses with 5 negative. I see Amazon happily offering many products with far worse stats. What is the story here When will the 'investigation' be over (Should the FBI be called in ) )"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Fantastic value for a great quality battery !
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Batteries came charged, I guess that's a good thing"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"It's a bunch of batteries, I have always had good luck with these batteries, All I know is you put them into the device it works"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I have been buying the bulk AA and AAA 'AmazonBasics batteries for some time now. They are delivered wrapped in groups of four and in a cardboard box. I have NEVER had a problem with any of them.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I have been using Amazon Basics products for about 2 years and have always found them to be first rate. The batteries last as long as the name brand batteries and cost a lot less.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"I have not yet determined the useful life of these when in use. I installed four in my camera last week. I just do not know how long they will last, but they look good"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Can not beat the price, since I got them, I started replacing some batteries. It's been several weeks, and I've had no issues with performance, and so far they seem to last just as long as name brand batteries that you would pay the same amount of money for and only get 4 batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I like how they are organized in the box into packs of 4. The box further separates them into groups and great to keep for storing them in. Batteries seem to work just fine. PLUS, they is cheap."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The batteries were put in each candles at the same time and set the timer to 8 hours on each.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Cheap! I like it.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I like the heavy card board box they come in. The strength (AAA, AA, C, etc) is printed on the side of the box. This gives you the ability to stack your batteries in a common 'emergency equipment' location so you know where to go when you need one. With the plainly marked sides, you can instantly see which box you want. This will gladly replace our current system: open a package of batteries, take 1 or 2, then put the rest back - someplace. We have batteries all over the place: some in in baggies, some loose in drawers, some still in their original packaging."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"In my opinion, works just as well as all the top name brand ones. I didn't perform any fancy tests, but I will buy them again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,As good as the copper ones for much less money. I got tired of paying through the nose for small packages of batteries at my local Wally World. It is nice to have a brick of batteries available. I actually used up half the box just getting everything stocked with new batteries. I liked them so much that I ordered the AAA and D cell boxes. As long as Amazon keeps making quality products for less money they will continue to take over the world.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I love how efficiently Amaozon packages their batteries. They seem to hold up comparably to other name brand batteries. Also they are so inexpensive!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,This pack of batteries is affordable and power-packed. I use these for my Tamiya collection it lasts really long. I love it!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries...i love it !
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I love the fact that you can get such a nice quantity of batteries for such a low price. Huge savings over big-box and grocery stores, and with a family of 4 kids and their army of battery-hungry toys, this deal is a life-saver."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Best batteries I've ever used and much cheaper than drug store or other stores. I used to buy other brands for much more and tried these and they are awesome.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These have some major juice! I love them! Long lasting and a kick-bootie price!!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I love these for the price I haven't noticed any difference between these and the major brands. but they are definitely better than Kodak and store brands I have tried.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I love these! I have them in black and the coral. Very comfortable. I wouldn't workout in them as the waistband is not snug, but do wear them around the house and when out running errands. Lightweight and wearable on warmer days."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,I mean..batteries They work.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I use lots of AAA batteries. I got a lot for the price. I like the neat way they were packaged. How long will the last At this price, it doesn't really matter"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I put these in some battery powered candles for a surprise harry potter b day for my girlfriend. We hung the candles from the ceiling. That was three months ago...the candles are still burning!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I ran my own longevity test and have the results. I have 4 identical candles, battery operated on a timer and sitting on the same table. I wondered myself which battery would last the longest. I put a EverReady battery in one, Rayovac battery, one AmazonBasics battery and one Maxell battery purchased from amazon.com. They were all purchased within a week of each other (thanks for friends and family that each donated two battery). The batteries were put in each candles at the same time and set the timer to 8 hours on each. After 25 days I had my first failure. The Rayovac candle didn't turn on. At day 26 the Maxell battery failed. and at day 27 the EverReady failed to turn on my candle. Along came day 27 - five hours into the 8 hour set timer and the AmazonBasics didn't make my candle work. I know this isn't a 'scientific' test but satisfied me as to which battery I will be buying from now on and those friends and family will now also be buying AmazonBasic Performance Alkaline Batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I really like Amazon batteries. I think they work just as well as any of the other brands, but at a much better price point."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"UPDATE June 2016Batteries do not last long at all. I am using mostly for wireless mouse. 1 battery last approx. 2-3 weeks. In my humble opinion, that is terrible. I retract my previous review.PREVIOUS REVIEW:Fantastic price, wonderful reliable product. I am a tried and true believer and purchaser."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"There are many batteries in the box for the amount of money you pay. Batteries at the store would cost way more. They seem to be packaged well, and conveniently. I took one star off because these batteries do not seem to last as long as the more expensive batteries, but it could just be the pack that i used. I will see how the rest will work out, but for the money, i think it is a good deal."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I use batteries for low drain electronics like hand held GPS. Tested these against Duracell copper tops and was surprised that the Amazon Basics last longer than Duracell. 24 hours vs 21. Not a huge difference but they are 1/2 the price:)
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Really high value batteries. I use them for my wireless mouse and they works fine.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Cheap AAA batteries! Haven't had any issue with them so far, I use them in stuff like... my nose hair trimmer."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,good battery life and pays to buy in bulk
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I use these on my Xbox one controllers. For the price they are quite a steal. I haven't really noticed a difference in battery life over other batteries. They get the job done, and I will definitely be using these batteries for the foreseeable future"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I used two of these recently and they worked very well. On long term use, I('m not sure. Thanks Amazon Calvin"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Never disappointed.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,This product was exactly as promised. I was pleased with the price and would purchase these batteries again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries were expired dead when they arrived at my house. I was very disappointed.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"pleasantly suprised, i was worried they would run out quickly but they work great"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I was expecting them to last as long as crappy walmart batteries. They last better than the Ikea ones! I love them, great deal!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,DID NOT LAST LONG
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,i won't buy batteries from home depot etc. anymore because these are equal quality to the well known brands and they are much cheaper and don't require sawing through plastic to open.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,this works well enough for the price point. I would recommend it if you are on a budget.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,We have been using these batteries for quite some time and none has leaked and all our products are still working that they are in. I would recommend!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works as intended. I would recommend!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great deal. Batteries are perfect!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,I miss the bunny with the drum.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I'm a huge fan of amazon so I figured I'd give these a shot. These have no life whatsoever. Even something as low-power as tv remotes they only last about 2 weeks tops.Spend the extra money and go with name brand.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Why spend money on overpriced batteries when you can get AmazonBasics! These batteries work great and are packaged so neatly for storage. I highly recommend ordering these.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I'm getting better results from these batteries than I do from the name brand. If the truth be known, they are probably made by one of the name brands."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,They don't last quite as long as regular batteries but long enough to still save money. I'm pleased with these batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"I don't notice any difference between these batteries and premium brand name ones They seem to last just as long, and at a great price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Batteries were decent. They came well packaged. I'm unsure how good they are as my son needed to replace his batteries on his game zone often. Although i replaced the Duracell batteries as well.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"This is the way to buy batteries, especially if you have Prime. Here's how my thinking goes: Running short on batteries Go to Amazon and order these again. It's Basics."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I've used these exclusively for my two Xbox One controllers and have not tried any other batteries in them. They lasted for about 48 hours of play time before running out. That seemed quick to me but I don't have anything to compare it to. These were the right price. I will order again when I remember to order batteries before I need them.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,once every other year and i never run out
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I have been a strong believer in Amazon batteries for years. If you do not feel like dealing with rechargeables, theirs are definitely the way to go. As good as any national brand in my opinion. Just another reason I love Amazon."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"If you have a prime, then this is a no brainer. Money-saver in the long run. Go ahead and buy!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I decided to give this 48 pack of AmazonBasics AA batteries a chance because with two kids I burn through batteries like crazy. First off the price was definitely better than buying even store brand batteries at a local store. It was definitely cheaper than buying brand name. I was really impressed with how they were packaged. They come in a nice little box with four batteries plastic wrapped together. I like that because the batteries stay nice and organized even once you open the package. The single packages inside are easy to open too. You just twist them and they break open so it's not like you have to grab scissors or a knife.As far as using them they work just fine. I'm no scientist so I've never sat down and done some experiment on these to track the use, but I can't tell the difference from when I was buying Duracell or Energizer or any other battery.We have used them in all kinds of kids toys, in remote controls and in our Xbox 360 controller. They seem to hold up well and I have not had any that did not work.Since I can't tell a difference in how they work or how long they last I will definitely get these since they are cheaper. And I like the packaging much better since I don't end up with batteries rolling all over our drawer where we keep them. Highly recommended!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good quality and price for families who have little kids (and lots of toys that constantly need new batteries!)
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,if you use batteries like I do I would recommend these. Much cheaper than buying locally and just as good if not better
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Each battery only lasts a few days on my wireless mouse.Update: the problem is actually with my mouse or computer other batteries are also draining too fast. Nevertheless, it would be good if these Amazon batteries stated their capacity."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"ill never run out of batteries again, well at least not for a while. i bought all these for christmas and they definitely came in handy for all the toys and items i bought my daughter, nieces and nephews for christmas"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Amazon basics products seem to impress me at times. I bought this batteries because I need them and didn't wanna pay the extra . I used them on my remote controls, led flashlight etc. and I'm certain that it will do the job."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Dont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I only buy my batteries from Amazon. They are inexpensive and last a long time! Super impressed with their quality of batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Inexpensive and they work perfectly.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,received quickly with n o damages. This battery seems to be the same as all the other ones.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Well, it is a good idea to stock up. I didn't do comparison to see if it was cost effective."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,This is so so.it is doing good.i do not know how long it can last.this is also pretty good.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,It worked great I like it you can't beat the price you get a lot for your money
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,There... There batteries. It would be pretty hard to screw this one up
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I mean, it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Pretty good batteries and arrived early for my gaming mouse.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,What can I say They are AAA batteries and I got them delivered in less than 24 hours. It's awesome!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,You get what you pay for. They do not last very long at all. It's better to buy Duracell.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Its a vey good and compact packaging.the batteries work awesome.I recommend it and would definitely buy them again
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries are good, they last longer than the usual brands I use. Its nice"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Its OK. Not much life in the batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,These batteries are just a tiny bit too short to work in every AAA device. Beware.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Just as expected. We used them for the lazer tag guns and they guns are still going strong after two weeks of constant use.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Just as good as leading brands, but alot cheaper. Will be buying more in the future."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works just as good as the big brand names at a fraction of the cost. I have stopped buying big brands and buy amazon batteries exclusively. have not sat down and compared hour life but seem to be just as good.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good batteries. Arrived just in time
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,What can I say - they work and last just as good as any other brand I have tried. I bought various sizes from Amazon and they all work great - just make sure you buy in advance to have them on hand for when you need them instead of running to the store forking over a lot more money for the same performance - I did buy the 9 volt box to replace all my fire alarms in the house - PERFECT!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Absolute best value for standard batteries (especially when using subscribe and save). If you aren't seeking rechargeable, I haven't ever been able to distinguish any real difference in quality or longevity between these and other top brands of batteries (Duracell, Energizer, etc.).Between my kids toys and my Xbox controllers, we go through about all of these batteries in about 6 months, so subscribe and save is the way to go."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Work great. No complaints.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I might even say they're better than name brand based on the price and quantity you get. Use them in everything from kids toys to flashlights to gaming controllers.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"For the price, these can't be beat. I don't have scientific measurements, but these seem to last just as long in my mouse, keyboard, remote, etc. as the more expensive brands do, for a lot cheaper. I like having a lot on hand so that I don't run out and have to pay more for them at the store, so I order these in bulk in different sizes and I'm always prepared. Overall, I've had really good luck with the Amazon brand."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"what can I say, they hold up as good as the name brand batteries. Great product"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These seem to be every bit as good as the name brands. Have used them in many applications.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good for the money.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Batteries worked well, just as well as the store bought ones but at a better price"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Maybe I received a defective batch but these are so bad.No longevity at all. Used up within 2 weeks whereas the branded ones last 2 months!I will not purchase them again regardless of the lower cost.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"A nice size bulk pack of AAA batteries. Beats the prices of what walmart or target has. These are NOT rechargeable, seen some people asking if they were in the question box. Will do just fine for remotes, flash lights, kids toys etc."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These come packaged into 4's, love that! I bought them specifically for the emergency lanterns I got and since they are packed separated into 4's I can put them with the lanterns perfectly. They work great and have had ZERO problems with these. Definitely recommend!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,For the deal on these you cannot beat the results. The battery is very similar to name brand batteries bought at local stores for twice the price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,You know these are just ok. They done last as long as the Copper top batterys.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Don't seem to last as long as other batteries, you get what you pay for."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great quality and super cheap! What else you can ask for
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,just trying
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Met my expectations for Alkaline AAA. I would recommend these to a friend.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Just what I wanted.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"I've read that these don't last as long as some other brands, but so far, I haven't had any issues. I don't use batteries for anything constant, however, remotes to the television primarily. They work great for that, and they cost less than other brands. Win win."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These have worked really well. I've had these batteries for a few months, and I don't think any of the items that I have used that required batteries have died yet. Hoping the batteries continue to work for awhile longer. It is really nice have a large supply of batteries especially since these last so long!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Cheap batteries and last about as long as the name brand batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"We've been going through a lot of AAA sized batteries and have been able to verify that these Amazon Basics batteries last just as long as other name brand alkaline batteries from Duracell, Rayovac or energizer in low and steady drain devices. Due to the price advantage we will keep using these."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Came as described and actually last for quite a while.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Everyone debates how long batteries last and these work perfectly fine. As a college student who spends a ton of time playing Xbox, my roomates and I went through batteries by the dozen and were always short. Instead of taking them out of any device we coud get our hands on (remotes, calculators, etc) we decided to just get these in bulk. They are much cheaper than getting anything in store and last long enough that we didnt notice a difference. A pair in an Xbox 360 controller lasted a good 4 months with almost daily use which is better than most batteries in my opinion."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Last just as long or longer than the name brands! I game alot and have been using Duracell or energizer, whichever is on sale. Decided to try these and so far I feel like they have lasted longer than the name brands. Ill update if this changes"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,First time trying the Amazon batteries and glad I did. These batteries have out lasted the Duracell batteries we used before and are cheaper! Will definitely purchase again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Last longer than any Alkaline I have purchased. Performance Alkaline Batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Two batteries came with my amazon basics mouse i bought. I was suprised that it took two years for them to die. Definitely buying again, highly recommend."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great Deal
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Awesome price! If there is a difference between these and the big name brand batteries, it's not a significant difference, because I can't tell. These seem to last just as long as the others in my opinion. Will always buy again!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I was very surprised when the package arrived. These are AA batteries!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I love these batteries because they are cost-effective and less expensive than buying smaller amounts of the same batteries at the store.These batteries last a long time, and it's nice to have them delivered!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great deal for long lasting batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works just as well as the top brands! Lasts a long time!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Fast shipping. Amazon basics last longer too. Been buying them for awhile
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Way great battery! I love em. Cheap and last forever.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Bought these March 2015. It's now Feb 2017 and my son said his toy lightsaber had just stopped working. Opened it up and batteries have leaked causing corrosion to contacts. No longer works, even with new batteries. It's not a very expensive toy, but the 1 most important aspect of a battery is that it not leak. What's the point of saving a few dollars on batteries if they are going to ruin something much more expensiveWith major brands, you can send in leaked batteries and device for repair or refund. Although I've never done thisThe version I bought were silver and green, so perhaps they have changed.Leaked batteries had 1.46,1.46,1.25v respectively."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I like these batteries, but a couple of times now after putting them in I have opened up the compartments to find battery acid leaking out inside, I figured it was just a one off, but it has now happened several times, I am reluctant to use them anymore in case I damage items"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries don't seem inferior to the more expensive Duracells and Energizer that we have been using. We have been using these primarily to go in our XBox One controllers, and they last a few weeks to a month with pretty consistent use, about the same as other AAs we have used. The price can't be beat, even cheaper than Costco at the time of purchase and with free shipping in hassle free packaging."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Pro: Relatively inexpensive, although I did end up waiting almost two weeks for delivery.Cons: High drop-out rate. They come in packs of four when used in Nikon cameras it's not uncommon to find after an hour of use that three of the cells have dropped to 1.48V while the fourth has dropped to...1.2V. They come out of the box within a hundredth of a volt of each other, so I'm guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or there's a interesting failure mode under load."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Life of battery varies with individual battery, which was disappointing. Maybe this is the difference between buying the house brand and buying the name brand--quality control."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Yes life short, that's right"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Life span long...performance upto satisfaction. Reliable. No failure. Only performance.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I will never need to buy batteries again. These are great , what I love is that they're not loose , they come together in packs of four."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I ordered these thinking they were rechargeable (I recognize the error on my part but that is not my complaint here) .. so when I received them and used them I was not surprised that they died VERY quickly. Upon attempting to recharge these I figured out they aren't rechargeable (Once again big duh on my part)..Now I'm seriously surprised that I'm only getting a few hours of use out of them!! like a quarter of the use that a typical battery should offer. Horribly disappointed.. I will go back to the name brand batteries for sure.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Really liked the batteries - seem to hold up well and keep a decent charge
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries seem to work as well as other brands at a much better price point.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Good knob. Looks good. Logo faded/wore off in a few months though... logo is kinda why I bought this, so.........."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Incredible deal for this prices, the batteries are long duration nice!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Excellent Batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries seem to last as long as the name brands you would purchase at the store. I have saved a lot of money by buying these in bulk instead of running to the store every time I need batteries. I am happy with these and will probably order more when I run out.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"THESE BATTERIES WORK JUST AS GOOD AS THE BRANDS YOU ALREADY KNOW, BUT DO NOT COST NEARLY AS MUCH MONEY. THATS A WINNER FOR ME."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"If you're looking for cheap but durable batteries look no further. I personally like amazon products. I know I can count on them as much as a named brand, but for a 1/4 of the price. I got these on Prime day for a great price and the last a OK amount of time. I used them on my xbox controller, but i think it soaked up more power than I thought so the batteries died with in a month or so. Its not like I keep track, but noticing the controller shutting off was what lead me on to the life of the batteries. I have enough to last me a year or so. Again, good buy. If you're looking to save money from the expensive name brands, go with a Amazon brand product its becoming more common and competitive as a name brand product."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Batteries work just as well as Duracell or whatever other name brand you can find at the stores. Long lasting and great quality. Will buy agian.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I needed some AAA's and decided to go with these since I no longer have an acive COstco membership. So far these batteries have held up very well in my remotes, several headlamps, and tactical flashlights that I regularly use. Great purchase"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I actually got the AA batteries some months ago and have found them to be amazing. We have so many electronics and remotes, and it seems that really good batteries are always in need. Just wish our town would make it a little more obvious as to where we can safely dispose of them when they finally do wear out."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Incredibly happy with AmazonBasics batteries.. The price is amazing and they last just as long as more expensive brands. Prime 2 day shipping has been a life saver when the kids need batteries and I don't have time to run to the store! Another great from Amazon!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I love all of the new AmazonBasics products, and these batteries do not disappoint. They seem to last so long, not like a discount battery at all. Happily, I have added them to my Subscribe and Save to stack an even bigger discount. I have yet to replace any of these, actually, now that I think about it! They seem to last a very long time, certainly as long as other major labels out there."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Same for these AA batteries as for the AAA batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"It's batteries. No really, it's just batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Great batteries! I have nothing negative I can say about this product. They work just as well as any name brand product you would buy off the shelf at any store except these are probably one quarter of the price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Too soon to tell but they seem fine
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Cant beat the price for the amount of batteries you get. Much cheaper than store prices, will buy again. Works just as good as brand name."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batterys last just as long as any other name brand, they are good."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Have been buying AmazonBasics batteries ever since they were introduced years ago. Lasts as long, if not longer than Energizer and Duracell for a fraction of the cost. Also, love the packaging: I store them in their box and it's so convenient to get to them when I need them."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries and great the price is great to I will almost definitely buy these again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love the price and quality. The quality is really good too. Ordered these for my office and figured I'd stock up at home for the price. They come packaged really well. I can always use extra batteries!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love the price of these batteries. They don't last as long as bigger brands like Duracell or energizer but you get a lot of batteries for not a lot of money so I love it.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great packaging!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love these batteries.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"In comparison to the name brand batteries, these are just as reliable. I cannot notice a difference between these batteries and the name brand batteries. Love them!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love this batteries. Better price and good batteries. I can't tell the difference between them and the big name brands.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Love this candle. When lights are turned out, it truly looks like a real candle. I bought 2 more and will probably get a few more for Christmas gifts."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Said it once and I'll say it again. Love Amazon batteries! Haven't beaten the price yet!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great quality for price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great price, great battery life, great look, just great, love it :D"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Been using Amazon AA and AAA batteries over the past 6 months in a variety of electronic items and have found that they do not last as long as higher quality, higher price batteries. I guess you get what you pay for!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Looks like these will be good for lower drain, standby applications, where battery leakage is a concern. I have given up on the Costco brand as they tend to leak in these types of applications. While overall watt-hour density is average, still good for remotes, and common applications. It's hyped about Japanese technology, but not made in Japan."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries perform just as well as the big name brands and for a fraction of the cost.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I am extremely disappointed with these batteries, which stems not from longevity or power, but with fit. Almost immediately upon receiving them I installed them into three electric candles. No joy. I cleaned the contacts, still no joy. I tested the batteries, full charge. Just for grins, I installed into one candle three Ray-O-Vac brand batteries, and the candle lit with no problem. Removed the Ray-O-Vacs, installed the Amazons, and again, no joy. I repeated this a couple of times with the same results. And I tried this in the other two candles with identical results: All three candles lit with the Ray-O-Vacs, none with the Amazons. Knowing the issue was not with candles, I took a Ray-O-Vac and lined it up with an Amazon, and discovered something interesting: the batteries were just a wee bit different.The length of the positive terminals are different, just a tad longer on the Ray-O-Vac (see picture). The Ray-O-Vac terminal is taller (longer) while the Amazon terminal is squat-tier and therefore shorter. The difference in length is tiny, no question: but when you're putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with, that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not. I'll keep the Amazons to use in devices (mice, for example) that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance (or a stronger spring) to hold the battery firmly in place. I am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device (that may not force as firm a connection) or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the get-go, use a branded-name battery.I am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of Amazon Basic computer cables (among their first products in the Basics line), but was recently disappointed with another item I purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line (that being dog house-training piddle pads, which have not proven as absorbent as similarly-priced products, and I've bought a lot of different brands). The batteries were my second foray into Basics product lines outside of the oh-so-dependable-cables arena, and now I'm 2 for 2 in the disappointed column. I never thought there was a difference in batteries, and now I know differently. The next time I see a Duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability, I'll think back to this experience, as I will when selecting batteries in the future. I so wanted to like these Amazon batteries, too."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I use these in my Bluetooth gaming chair's transmitter that uses 2 AAA's. Approximate battery life is 50+ hours. Incredible!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,I bought them to go into a flashlight. They never lasted more that a few hours and got really dim. maybe good for things like remote controls
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Lasted one month in my carbon monoxide detector. Maybe these are good for other applications, but disappointed with their performance."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Can't beat the price for all these batteries. Why would people go to local store and pay exorbitant prices for batteries which you can get at a cheaper price. Maybe they last as long say for instance like Duracell or Eveready but for the price of an off brand, it is still well worth it."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,These are decent cheap batteries but they don't last as long as Eveready Or Duracell or Rayovac. they really are only good enough for remotes and the like. I don't like to use them in anything else.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,Bummed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicker or something that isn't used often but we used these for Xbox one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"These do not last nearly as long as a name brand battery. So considering the cost/benefit, i'm not really sure if they are any better"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,They don't last as long as other batteries. The Rayovacs that I get from Lowes are way better.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great bang for the buck. Amazon batteries....Who knew
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I'm a self proclaimed bargain shopper. But at the same time I want a quality product. I make a point of reading reviews to make sure that there are some satisfied customers before I take a chance on a product. I'm happy to say that these batteries were a good choice. I have grandkids that love to play video games using remotes that use 4 batteries per controller. They go through these things like crazy. So, finding some that were affordable was necessary to keep everyone happy."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I can never have enough batteries. We use them so quickly, I love to have extra boxes. These were a good price and they seem to work well."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great deal on these! Seem to have more initial power than most alkalines. Great for my electric razor! Get them if you have kids with lots of toys that eat batteries!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great, but would like higher rating rechargeables."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Worked well. I got these for some remote control mice I had purchased. Much fun was had scaring the office staff.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Cant beat these batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"So far, so good. My new source for batteries. I love me some Amazon"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These are now my go-to batteries....sorry copper top. I used them for lights at my daughter's wedding and they are still going strong!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Best way to have electronics work is having them be charged or have batteries! Buying this pack will fix the needing batteries part!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,My son goes through batteries like crazy so I bought him this pack for his birthday no complaints and they last a lot longer than dollar store batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Name-brand batteries are great. But, they do cost a bit more than lesser-known battery brands. Amazon may not be known for their batteries, but they have a good name. And if they are going to put their name on a product I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt that the product will work well. So far, so good - with these batteries. Good price... arrived quickly... and, are working fine. Whether they last as long as other brands I have yet to discover."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,stock up on these at a great price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These we got for the flashlight for a birthday party. They work.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I have no qualms about the quality of these batteries.I only wish that every 4 batteries were not individually wrapped.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I have these on the subscribe and save listNever had any issues with old batteries or out-of-dateevery order has been perfect.My only small gripe is they seem do not last very long.But value wise they still beat buying name brandsI.D. (Indiana Dan)
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good to have A batteries at such a good price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,This box of batteries was a great value. Better than buying from the other box stores. I like how they came in an easy to open cardboard box. Each set of 4 inside the box is wrapped in a thin layer of plastic so the batteries don't roll around and make a mess. I used these to replenish all my kids' talking/lightup toys...as those toys don't generally work well with rechargables. I'm going to buy more of these as needed!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries are less expensive and have more charge than most store-bought batteries. You'd have to be insane to not buy them.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,The package just arrived and all seems well. I have no information on the life of these batteries. If they do well I would be glad to give them 5 stars.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Put together mobile but it refuses to turn. Kind of pointless. Next time would spend a few more dollars and get something more sturdy and reliable.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,good batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries for a great price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,great price - perfect for what I needed it for

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Needed some decent batteries. Gets the job done.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These are good batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works great
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"These don't last quite as long as Duracell, but for the price it's hard to complain. Nice basic batteries. No issues except for slightly shorter lifespan."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"This is my second batch. These batteries are perfect for what I needed. In my experience, they seem to be just as good as the more expensive name brands."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Nice batteries, good price!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Nice box, good price. Only improvement would be to eliminate the 4pack wrapping. The clear plastic wrap seems like an unnecessary step when changing our kids toy batteries"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These work very well and are priced well. Just as good as Duracell or Everteady or other major brands.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Packaged nicely.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great price and work great. They come in a sturdy box and are wrapped as 4 packs in plastic.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I like that I can order these on-line with Prime shipping directly to my house in a few days. I use a lot of batteries during the holidays starting with Halloween through Easter. Not a bad price and they seem to last awhile.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Bought these on Amazon for a good price, but they just don't seem to last very long. The packaging and batteries look nice. None of them leaked, but that could be because I went through them so fast."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Cheap Batteries! Nice!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great deal great product!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,NICE. WORKED GREAT. DID THE JOB.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Some of the best batteries I've ever bought. Last a long time, and VERY nicely packages. Batteries are individually packaged into packs of 4 so that is very nice."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Seems as good as the ones in the store.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries last as long as many of the name brands. They are packaged in sets of 4 in a sturdy box, and the individual packages are easy to open. No complaints in regards to price and longevity of use as I'm getting the same amount of use out of things like my battery operated mouse as I would with a name brand."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I would say these are better than the cheaper name brands ... But, not as good as the high dollar name brands. They fall in the middle, and for the price you really can't complain!!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"they're batteries, they're cheap, and they work just fine"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries work great! No issue with battery life. I order this pack every few months to keep up with our computer mouse, video game controllers, and misc battery needs. Can't beat the price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,No complaints here! Very satisfied with these batteries. So far I've used them primarily in LED candles and they've worked great basically on continuously. I think they are comparable to the Kirkland brand that I normally use. I will buy again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,No complaints.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good. I'll buy all my batteries from Amazon basics in the future.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I wanted solar batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Put 18 of the batteries in devices already and they all work. Fast delivery no issues
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,They last as long as Rayovac batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,They work great and a price nicely
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries worked just fine and unlike the last Energizer batteries, they didn't leak. I'll never buy Energizer again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These batteries do not last long. I put some in a portable can opener and was able to open about 10 cans.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Good Deal for the price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Cannot beat the price. High performance to cost ratio. I did not do any drain test but used them on xbox controllers and seem to last just as long as Duracell or Costco batteries. Free shipping makes it 5 stars.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"No problem with these batteries. They get used in various remotes, USB devices and other low-wattage draw items, so it is hard to say how well they will last. However, I have not had an issue to date. Will buy again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,No problems. Expectations met. No fuss.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Best battery buy in town. So far, no duds. I have been buying for the last 3 years and worth the price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"There ok, not as good as I would of liked for what I need them for. I would purchase again.Fast , good delivery."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I bought 20 and I used 9 in three Motorola Walkabouts radios.One the second use, after only two hours use on first, a battery failed. I was shocked at this. It made my Walkabout useless for the child-safety reason I bought it.Noqw I cannot trust the rest and I will use then in unimportant places like toys."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries did not even last a day with some LED lights we used. I do not recommend these to anyone. Go with a good brand name.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Don't last quite as long as name brand, but worth the money."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries leaked into my mouse and killed it. Not cool Amazon.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,Certainly not as good as Duracell. Some are very good........ others go bad in as little as two weeks. I put 3 in a plugged-in weather radio to serve as battery back up. Got a message that batteries needed replacing after only 2 weeks. A battery tester confirmed that they should be replaced. I guess I will go back to the Duracells.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Bought these for my digital camera based on a semi-professional review. Each set of 2 lasted less than an hour in my camera. Have used other brands of regular AA batteries and they have lasted much longer. If it's cameras you're buying them for, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great battery, great price. NOT frustration-free though. Each row of 4 batteries was wrapped up so you had to open 12 packs individually."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These worked for about a week. Then started leaking and just stopped working. I ended up throwing them away. I even had to throw a string of lights out because of the leaks of batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"ehh...they run out of charge very quickly....its honestly bad for the environment. they do seem to be a bargain but a brand name might come in a smaller quantity but will last longer than these..update 1: these batteries pack's have 50 working(short term) and 50 non-working batteries...I brought multiple battery packs and all have batteries that don't work.In my estimation, i think these batteries are not worth it."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,Good Value but they dont last very long
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I will not purchase these again. They last about 1/2 the life of the Duracell ones.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"These are not comparable to Duracell. I have been running around changing batteries everywhere, remotes, clocks, battery-powered soap dispensers. All the dying batteries are the lame Amazon basics. Bought duracells at Costco. They probably last twice as long. I bought these to get free shipping on orders over 35. Don't do the same. It's not worth it. Very disappointing."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great price for batteries and they work!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,I thought from the reviews that I had found a really good battery for less money than I usually paid for DuraCell but I was wrong. I put these in a my battery operated Halloween decorations and they lasted exactly 3 weeks on a 4 hour timer mode. The pumpkins where I used DuraCell are still glowing brightly. Guess it's back to the other brand for my battery operated Christmas decorations.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These batteries don't seem to last quite as long as regular brand name.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Not suitable for toys. Drained within just a couple of days.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I use these all the time. They have come in handy for a few remotes that we have gotten and only used these sized batteries. They last a decent amount of time. Not the greatest but also for the size they work well.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Definitely not Duracell, but it gets the job done. Last for a while, but died sooner than expected."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"About the same as Ray O Vac, not very good."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These batteries were horrible. They died with a couple of days use. I figured since they were Amazon brand they would be good but I was mistaken. Sorry I would not recommend these to anybody.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Not worth a crap don't waist your money. I purchased these for under cabinet lighting and they hardly have enough power. The light is way more dim than other batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"This batteries didn't last very long in anything we used them in (clock, toy, flashlights). Would not buy them again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,They simply do not last very long. Not worth the money.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Just ok
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"In a world where AA Alkaline Batteries are essentially obsolete, these batteries by AmazonBasics get the job done. I used these for a Logitech wireless mouse and they have worked fine. Overall, I would recommend these batteries to anyone looking for both performance and value."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Overpriced, works about the same as raovac."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Just batteries. Nothing special or bad about them.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Usually I buy bricks of batteries from Fry's Electronics, but I had an Amazon gift card, so I figured I would give them a shot and they make my devices work!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Obviously they are excellent batteries where you can get them in a very nice small package so it is not taking up much room. The batteries themselves work as well or better than other brands that I have purchased. I only purchase AmazonBasics Alkaline Batteries for all the sizes that we need.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These perform as well as your typical name brand batteries at a lesser price. I'll continue to buy these in lieu of the more expensive ones.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Long lasting cheap batteries what more do you ent
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,good deal
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,How do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,not what I was looking for but they are ok.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,OK
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,ok
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,They seem fine to me.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Pretty good but the batteries do get used up fairly quickly. I use them for wireless mics and they last for maybe 5 or 6 hours TOPS. I need to compare them with Duracell to really get an idea of their quality.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I have a digital charger that has been very effective at recharging alkaline batteries. I usually get two or three 90 charges from a quality battery before it starts to leak. These are fine for their original life, but none could handle a recharge. Yes, I know that's what all alkaline batteries advertise, but at this price, which is equivalent to what I pay for Maxell and others, I expected a more robust container."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a tv remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are OK."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Worked great!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I recently bought these to use in my Streamlight Microstream flashlight. I've carried one every day for the past 4 years and I love them. I say them because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,They work greatcame very late though
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Package arrived with one battery missing :(
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Bad quality, many of the batteries were blank, not charged. Some only lasted for a week or so."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Batteries are awful. Might get 1/4 the life other batteries Ive used. Will not be buying Amazon batteries again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Batteries did not last more than two days
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,batteries didnt even last one month...very dissapointed

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,No good...worthless. I have no use for them.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,None of the batteries work
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Not universal. Did not work on garage door opener, given as gift but now cannot return."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,poor quality
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Returned for later purchase
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Run down very quickly!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,should buy duracell
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Terrible battery life!!!!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,That's crap
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,The package was open and missing two batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These batteries are awful, have no power and die fast"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,these batteries do not last long and we have quite a few that are leaking..

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These die way too fast.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These suck. Had for a week. Stopped working. Garbage.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,theses batteries don't last very long not worth the money
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,they are terrible
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,they do not last at all would love to get my money refunded.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,They paired these with a order that uses AA
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Total crap. Batteries last for minutes.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Used these for 2 insta bulb lights purchased from here also and they last about a week. Crazy!!!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Utterly worthless, no staying power."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Wore out way to fast
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Worst battery I've ever used. Lasts 1/3 as long as eveready!!!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Wrong Item
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I only buy batteries from Amazon. Love the Duracell Procell deals but the Amazon branded batteries seem just as good. No way can I score these deals locally.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,only 4 stars need 5 or 6 years to prove there leak proof. Tip Duracell's have destroyed far too many of my devices.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Not much to say about batteries but I really love the Amazon Basics products. Great price and same performance as Duracell or similar popular brands.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,What can I say here. These batteries are fantastic. I'll never pay for brand name batteries again. This is the only way to go!!!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Do not leave these batteries sitting on a dresser... or pretty much anywhere you don't want battery acid leaked onto. We took the batteries out of our remote at night and woke up to our brand new 3500 dresser ruined. Awesome.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Best price for a none name brand battery, however, they last just as long as name brands for a pack of batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great price, long lasting and got to my home very fast!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great batteries for an outstanding price! Order here, not through your local store - you'll regret it! It's nothing better than having a drawer full of batteries, too, for those last-minute needs!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Haven't used them, they look fine. Probably overpaid. They arrive in a fancy cardboard box, like they're collectibles or something."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,There were 2 batteries missing from the pack. Just annoying enough to write a bad review. Not annoying enough to do anything else about it...
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,A++
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Another brilliant amazonbasics product. Works better then the brand name batteries and last longer.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,As good as any other battery brand on the market

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Perfect for our emergency survival basement pantry. I haven't opened the box, and just sealed them in plastic."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Excellent value. These come packaged in little sleeves of four in a large cardboard box. Amazon Basics batteries have always been good performers. We've been using them for a couple of years and haven't had any issues with them drying up quickly or being lackluster upon first use. Nice quality, great deal."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"With alot of kids and toys in the house we have been running through hundreds of batteries. Yes hundreds, no typo. I have found these batteries to have the perfect balance of cost vs longevity. They dont last the longest but theyre priced just right to make it worth it. I would recommend to anyone that needs batteries in bulk."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"We got these for our TV remote. We didn't need such a large package, but it was the cheapest option, so we went ahead and purchased the 20 pack. It was great to be able to save money over the name brands, and since it was Amazon brand, we figured they would be good quality (and we were right). It was also awesome to be able to get them in 2 days, since our TV buttons are very hard to use so the shorter time without a remote, the better!Work great. Probably won't run out of AAA anytime soon, but would consider buying other sizes when needed."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,You can trust Amazon to bring you great products at great price
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far batteries are good
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Any parent of toddlers knows that there are numerous toys that require AAA batteries.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"As a mommy to 2 little ones, we go through a lot of batteries around here. Toys require batteries. The baby's vibrating music player requires batteries. And heaven forbid that the baby's music player runs out of batteries!I bought these batteries after reading the good reviews. I'm very impressed that these seem to perform just as well as the Duracell batteries that I normally buy. I haven't noticed any difference in performance or duration. And AmazonBasics are about half the price of the Duracell batteries. Thank you for helping me save money, AmazonBasics!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries at a great pricr
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Cant beat it.. performs just as good if not better than the big brands, at more than half the cost.. Life span is awesome thus far.. ill never buy from the big guys again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Pleasantly surprised with these batteries. Powered my son's toy tablet quite well along with other remote control cars that they use.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,Poor life. Buy a known brand.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Batteries seem to have very short life.........
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Multiple batteries leaked, ruining one toy and causing messes in other items. Poor quality."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won't last mare than a week in my TV remote. Pretty annoying!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I did a simple test with 2 identical falmeless candles that run on 2 AAs. Amazon Basics AA kept the candle going as long and bright as brand new Energizers. Pretty darn good deal!!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great cheap batteries. No more over paying for them!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Good price, time will tell on durability"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I haven't even used one yet but I suspect they will work. I stocked up on these because I have a lot of stuff that uses AAA's and it is a super price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"These batteries are nothing special. They do the job, probably not as good as some name brands but good enough for my wireless trackball."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Order got lost and took longer (weeks) than expected. Product is great though.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good testing fully charged
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Quality batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I purchased AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries in July. It has now been two and a half months since I have been using them. They are definitely comparable to the leading brands out there. They are also much more affordable. We have used them in everyday items that need batteries. We mainly use them in our remote controls. Before, it always felt like we were replacing our batteries constantly or hunting for batteries. It was nice to buy this pack to have them readily available and also have the option to purchase recurring delivery if we need them...which is something I will definitely consider because of the convenience. I just need to figure out now how often I need them. This pack has lasted awhile."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I bought these basically because they are by Amazon and I love and trust their brand to produce high quality products. So I bought packs of AA and AAA when I bought some flashlights on Prime Day. They seem to work great and I expect they will last a long time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Easy to open and store . . . equivalent battery life with more expensive brands!For those of us who do not like 'real' shopping These are Amazon Prime 2 day delivery.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Glad I ordered this many. I had no idea I'd use nearly half the box as soon as I opened it. Now I need to do the same with AA size as many applications say specifically not to use rechargeables. Believe them! I tried it once before and pretty much melted down the item and destroyed the batteries as well. Apparently they are not made to supply as much current and they will let out the (magic) smoke. These came in quickly and are just what I needed
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I saw reviews for batteries on the news and these were rated among best. I'm so glad I can get these from Amazon in bulk for a great price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Hope the feedback, review and pictures I post here will help a few fellow Amazon shoppers:Quality 10/10 Freakin Amazon man!

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Good quality
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"When I heard one of the consumer gurus on the radio a few years ago saying that some of the generic or lesser known brands of batteries were often as good as the name brands, I tried a pack of the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries instead of the usual name brand. I've bought several packs since then, and although I haven't done any objective testing, they appear to be about as long-lasting and reliable as any other brands that I've tried. Some of the batteries were installed a couple of years ago, and they still have some charge, and there's been no leakage or corrosion. I've been very pleased with the AmazonBasics alkaline batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"I have switched to AmazonBasics brand after trying just about every brand there is. Good, reliable batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Quality and battery life is the same as name brand. Reminds me of the days when you could go to Radio Shack and get some good, inexpensive batteries. So far, I haven't had an AmazonBasics products I haven't liked."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same...
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Given its price, probably makes sense but doesn't last very long even with lower power usage or lesser used devices. I'd spend few dollars more and buy Duracell pack from Costco."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries are safe for children, because it features an anti-leakage style. Plus, it's eco-friendly so it's not just good for your child, buy also in your surrounding."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I love the concept of Amazon basics. I look forward to the savings that can be passed to consumers (hopefully) by stripping out a lot of the non-sense associated with consumer products (marketing, packaging, etc.) I see no difference between these and brand name batteries other than the cheaper prices."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Perfectly suitable alternative to the overpriced Duracell and Energizer batteries. I didn't notice any difference in performance, and I will never buy the expensive brands again after finding Amazon Basics!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"So far they're holding up just like the brand name versions, but they're much cheaper."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These seem to be performing well so far. I've already gone through half. I haven't done any special tests to compare them to more name brand batteries but so far I've not had any issues. My daughter drained one of her video games in about the same time as she does with some of the other brands - but I didn't time it or anything. All of them were there - came nicely packaged and I like the price. I will most likely continue to buy these batteries now for the convenience and lower price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Cheap, works, better quality then duracel."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Don't seem to last as long as the big name brands, however, for the price you will get more run time per money spent."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries work as long, if not longer, than the big name batteries. I love them! I swear by them in my remotes for my TV, sound system, Blu-Ray player, TiVo, and Roku!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I love the money Amazon brand saves us, these batteries work and last just as well as name brand!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These are excellent batteries and the price is right.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"They are batteries, so can't say I love them! But I've had good results with Amazon's AA's so trying these now."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I'm not entirely pleased with Amazon's batteries. It seems to me that these have been dying faster than the bulk pack I got at Costco long back (which lasted a long time!). I don't think I'll get these again, I'm returning to the name brands at Costoco once these are used up (and they are getting used up at a rapid pace)."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Seem to work as well as the big brands at half the cost, no brainer buy. I'm about to get the AAA batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"seems just as good as higher-priced batteries. I have had good experience with an AmazonBasics wireless mouse I've been using for 1 1/2 years, and the reviews for these batteries are excellent. For the price, I am fully satisfied."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"expiration of 2026, about 9 years in advance of when I received these.Batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of 5 which is good to provide for protection from discharge after part of the package is opened."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I ordered a 20 pack of AA batteries from amazon when they were on sale. Seems like my kids are going through batteries like crazy with their gaming controllers and such. My household ends up going through AA batteries like there is no tomorrow! So when i saw these were on sale, i had to order some. I decided to hide these ones from the kids, so i could see if they were comparable to the store bought batteries that seem to always die on us rather quickly. So far my husband has had a set of these batteries in his xbox controller for days now and they are still going strong. Same with the wii controller- which has a battery indicator even, still says full battery. So far, i am very happy with these batteries and plan to purchase more in the future!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Seems to be a good product. not sure they have a very long life.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,One of my 48 batteries arrived with what looks like a leak. The rest look fine so I'll just keep them. Otherwise these batteries work just fine.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. Out of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,short battery life
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Lasted for barely any time at all. I have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but I can attest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the Amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands. I'm always willing to give Amazon products a try, but these batteries left a lot to be desired."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These batteries do not have a long life.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,They really don't last very long
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Batteries last about a week in a wall clock- name brands last six months. Don't waste your money.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"We have been extremely disappointed in these batteries. Put them in our game camera and they were dead after two weeks. Should have lasted two or three months. Same thing with everything we have used these batteries for. Don't waste your money, Buy Duracell instead."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"So at first I was happy, but my computer mouse started flashing red (low battery) about a week of having the new battery. Not impressed with battery life, but it works short term."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"should have bought the bigger pack, used most of these up already, forgot how much stuff I had that uses AAA batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"Nice bag, however did not come with the shoulder strap, which is one of the main reasons I wanted this particular model."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Excellent long lasting batteries ,put all the expensive stuff to shame, SHIPPED IN AWESOME LITTLE AMAZON BOX ......."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I like these shoes but Altra needs to pay more attention to sizing. I normally wear US 7.5-8. The first pair of Superior 2.0s I ordered was size 8 and they were way too short. OK, I thought, they run short. I ordered a pair size 8.5 and they were just barely long enough.I ordered a second pair size 8.5 and they are visibly half an inch shorter than the first size 8.5 pair. That isn't running short, it's lack of quality control.I really like these shoes, so I am ordering size 9's. But I do not have any warm feelings about Altra."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The package is A LOT smaller than I thought. That'snice.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Same soap as always but a smaller size than I thought.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good. Will update if anything changes.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,So far so good. Working well with my light mirror and it's been holding a good amount of power for a good amount of time.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Time will tell how well they perform. They are a little less expensive than Energizer and if they perform as well I'll re-order them.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Price is right. So far so good for quality!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so Good !

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"So far so good. Great value. Well packaged, nice clean design and arrived quickly."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good. The batteries are working great. I do like how they are packaged in groups of 4 inside a box. It keeps them in order once you remove a bundle or two.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Bought for camping batteries, so far so good. .. we'll see if there are any issues after storing for a few months. Amazing price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good...good value overall time will tell how long they will last but will update if they don't last as long as name brands
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I'm using three now and so far they're good. I love the flat sturdy box they came. Perfect for storing. Also a lot more batteries than I realized. :-)
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I have been using these batteries for about a month now and the half I have used have performed very well. The Batteries I inserted into 3 items when they arrived are still working.So far I have found no bad batteries included in my order.Would recommend based on performance of the batteries I have used so far.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"So far, so good!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"So far, so good. I haven't had them in a device long enough to report on actual battery life."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"So far, so good. They all seem fully charged and last as expected."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Enough batteries to power my remote for a decade. I would have loved this many AAs for my Gameboy growing up.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works great in my xbox controllers and wii controls!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,not long lasting move on pay more get more
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"So, I now have an angry 2 year old. A broken new toy. And batteries that I cannot trust. I put new batteries in the toy and it stopped working a couple days later. I opened it up to find some batteries leaked also ruining the toy.Edit: Amazon has made since replaced the batteries for me."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I don't think I can find cheaper Alkaline batteries to be honest. Their life is pretty good too.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,It is the first time I purchased Amazon Basic AA Alkaline batteries and I am glad I did. It is a solid performer at reasonable price.. Will buy more in the future for sure!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Sleek design. Comes with batteries needed. I've compared the number to another scale that same day hours later and it displayed the same number. I'd say it's very accurate. Clear display, thin black platform. Your typical scale. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my honest opinion. I'd buy again and would recommend to a friend. Solid product."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,Some batteries worked okay. I just had a problem where a new battery worked for a week and then there was no charge. Not worth the price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"For the price and quantity I was sure this would be a great buy. Sadly, not all of the batteries worked. I first thought the camcorder we purchased was defective but when I swapped out the fresh, new batteries for a second round of fresh, new batteries from the same package the device magically came to life. Boo to you Amazon for selling batteries that don't actually work."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Exceptional batteries for the price. Just as good if not betterthan major brands. Sometimes you just pay extra for the brand. That is a waste of money.Quality can be found at a reasonable price like these batteries. Duracell and other brands are asking you topay for there brand name. Sometimes there is a difference. In this case I could not find any reason to pay a higher price.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These do not hold charge for long.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Works like a standard alkaline battery.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,If you have kids you need these! We were pleased. These powered all the birthday gifts without a problem.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Who doesn't need batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Worst batteries I've ever bought. Last about two weeks in a remote control.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These do not work good in cameras. I use a small point and shoot Cannon Camera for work. With these batteries I seem to be changing them almost every time I go out. Other name brand batteries seem to last 3-4 time longer.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"So far so good!, I put dates on these batteries to check the life line when installed into batteries power items. I'll have future updates on this items. Stand by!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Got enough now for any possible hurricane, tornado, earthquake, and other disasters that take out the electricity. YOU can never have too many batteries, just in case."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,Stocked-up
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Convenient and inexpensive. Comparable to Duracell and energizer. Can't tell the difference.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Xbox remote. The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them 3x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These work as well as the name brand batteries but are cheaper and better quality than even dollar store batteries. I use the subscribe and save service Amazon offers for batteries, wipes etc and save even more making them an even better value. At the rate my kids use AA batteries for their Xbox controllers, we need value!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Very nice packaging! Love the price and the nice convenient packaging makes it easy to store, find and keep track of the batteries. Great job Amazon!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries are a really great buy, same quality as the name brand batteries at a much better price"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"My daughter has this terribly annoying doll that sings and dances. She has it playing 24/7, and these batteries are apparently going to last until the end of time. I almost want to drop my rating down because they work a little too well."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Just what I wanted. Last long enough to consider it as my preferred AAA batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"lasted long, super reasonable price"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"We bought these batteries to use in a medical Holter Monitor. Typically we put batteries in for 24 or 48 hour monitors. After one use, we need to replace the batteries. These batteries did not even last the 24 hours. Patients wasted their time and the testing was wasted. It was embarrassing to make the patient reschedule their test due to our equipment failure. These cost our business money. Will never buy again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I read somewhere that batteries were one of the more over-priced items we buy. Why get those expensive brand name batteries when generic batteries last just as long This is a super buy.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Just as good as the name brands, maybe better. I use these in the Holiday decorations and still going strong!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"So far these batteries have outlasted the Duracell batteries they replaced in my Xbox remote, at a fraction of the cost!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,They work great!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works good and there are cheap. I will be buying more then I need them!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I will probably never buy batteries anywhere but here again. My husband is a gamer and typically blows through all kinds of batteries but these do the trick. I havent noticed them needing replacement any more frequent then other major brands like duracell or energizer
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Most of these batteries either do not have any life left to them or they are die out after one use. terrible product.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Can't believe Amazon's name is on these pieces of dung. Very short life. I've migrated to Eneloop rechargeables for AAA as well as AA now big savers, as I have a lot of doodads."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,terrific
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Trst
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Thank You!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I think most of the batteries I have in my house are now all AmazonBasics. These batteries are in all of our toys, gadgets, remotes and I have never had an issue. They last as long as expected."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great staple...
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The appear to be as good as the rayovac's my kids blow through in the gaming controllers and at a slight savings. I think we'll keep using them!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"The batteries appear to be working great. I've been using two AA's in my Xbox One controller for over a month now. If you can get a sale on these like I did, buy, buy, buy!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries work just as well as name brand batteries while being substantially cheaper. These are also packaged well. The cardboard box is slim and holds its shape unlike a normal plastic battery box. The batteries are shrink-wrapped together so they stay nicely in place. I just take some from the end and leave the remaining batteries nicely in their package.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run certain toys. We hve a snap circuit kit and it doesn't power it enough to make the fans fly. A little disappointed.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I use these for reading lights (the kind you clip on a book) which I use for coloring. The light gets dimmer after a few hours use the batteries I get from dollar tree last the same if not better. Duracell and energizer, however, last at least 20 hours before the light gets dim."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,The batteries work fine. So far they seem to last quite a while. Haven't used them for very long to determine if they are any better than other batteries I have used/
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The batteries work well.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,love the easy to open packaging! these batteries long very long in my dslr camera!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Would not buy these again. I reluctantly gave it a 2nd star because the price was good, but the batteries are pretty much 1 star. These get pretty good reviews so I was excited about them. Then the kids kept coming back WAY TOO FAST asking for batteries for their Wii remote. It didn't make sense to me until I tossed some in my blood pressure monitor. That thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries, but not these! Only weeks with these. I don't have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them, but the proof is in the usage.......it's awful. Buy something else with a brand name."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn't work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn't work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These DO NOT WORK. I have tried them in 2-3 different clocks, and they are not working at all. When replaced with other batteries, the clocks started to work fine again.You get what you pay for..."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"The latest reviews of name brand batteries have gone downhill lately. It seems they leak, rust, don't last, etc.. Perhaps Amazon is licensing older battery technology, or their manufacturer is anyway. So what These work better than the name brands! These are the only batteries I will buy, except Lithium Smoke Detector batteries. Amazon Any plans for Lithium batteries"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,The only batteries that I buy now! Price is great and they seem to hold up as good as their more expensive competition.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Never knew that Amazon sold batteries until now. Stop buying those batteries at the grocery store and use these! I always run out of batteries in my wireless mouse and keyboard at the worst time because I ignore the low battery warnings. These batteries come in a small cardboard box about the size of 2 boxes of office pens. Inside, the batteries are wrapped in packs of 4 which keeps them neatly organized inside.Overall, these works extremely well and I will never buy batteries at the store again."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,A++++ Seller. The Product was excellent and exactly what i needed.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Those of us in World War II can all appreciate what was happening in the South Pacific while we were elseware. I was in the North Pacific at a secret U.S.-Russian site where we were planning a joint attack of Japan. We hear nothing about what was happening farther South. The book ansered our questions.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"The package provided good quality batteries in a size I need most often, without including other sizes of less usefulness. I also appreciated the packaging, which is more accessible than the common drugstore packages (which can be a challenge to open)."

Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pics.(like energizer)......

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Well, I usually write extensive reviews on products, but really there isn't much to say here. Lets cut to the chase. They are batteries. They are AAA size. And they work. No, they aren't the equivalent to lithiums and no they won't power your space shuttle to the moon, but what do you expect at this price I was going to test the actual mah of the battery, until I remembered how much I paid for them in comparison to the big brands I've purchased in the past at the drug store. Bottom line: A good mix of quality / quantity. They aren't your cheapest, junkiest battery but they also don't compare to the best AAA's, Energizer Lithiums. Mid-grade at a great price. Got lots of electronics needing AAA Get them. If you're needing to use them in place of rocket propellent, look elsewhere."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These are fantastic alkaline batteries that work just as well as some of the name brands. They are long lasting in my controllers, remotes, clocks, devices, and more. I highly recommend them. Great price too. Compare and save."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"These are fine, for the price but not as Duracell"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These are great batteries for around the house and I don't notice any runtime difference between them and the other major brands. The price is awesome, and they work as expected. Nothing else to say about AA's really :)"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These are great quality at an even better price. I am always rummaging through the junk drawer in desperation when the remote dies mid Netflix binge. Now I can binge on for all eternity!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These are my new go to for batteries. Last holiday season I used these batteries in half of our window candles and Duracell it the other half. Basically no difference in battery life and the price can't be beat. If anything, the candles with these batteries lasted longer."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"This battery is fine, but I purchased it because I thought it was rechargeable. Shame on me for not noticing, but I thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones I had purchased before. I bought it on Prime Day for about 6, so I thought I was just getting a great deal.Disappointing. I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,These are OK for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Costco Kirkland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Arrived on time, battery doesn't last very long though even when fully charged, so that's my only concern."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These are really good batteries. We have gotten these a few times now and haven't had any issues with them at all.

These are a good buy. would definitely recommend these batteries to other people.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far I love it very good price and all the batteries are fully charged :) (I checked!)

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries are awesome, i will be ordering these again! we have a rc car and had in brand new brand name batteries and the rc car was slower than when we put in the amazon batteries!! you could tell the difference. They don't get hot easily. They also last awhile."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Crazy good deal. These batteries are easily every bit as good as top brand name batteries. My kids now prefer amazon batteries to any other in their console controllers... which I think says a lot. Great job Amazon!!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell AA in my small Christmas light strings and they last me 2.5-3 weeks with being constantly on. These have lasted about 4 days with the same use. I read other reviews which stated they were the same but it wasn't until I put them in my normal light strings that I saw the difference. Will NOT order again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I keep a good stock of batteries in my house. We have lots of flashlights and toys that require them. These are nicely affordable and I compare them to Energizer batteries, easily. (Don't look at 2nd pic if you're OCD )"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries are great, I used Duracell before for my remotes etc, but i am impressed with these, I am getting much longer life from them. I am updating this review, this will be the only battery I use, they last a long time, and are a good price!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries are great. They last forever and are much cheaper than the name brands. Will continue to buy.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries do what batteries need to do. I'm writing a review b/c this was an Alexa deal, which she told me was 5, and was charged 8."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These batteries don't work well! My bluetooth mouse wouldn't stay on any more, even when I put fresh Amazon batteries in them. So I bought a new mouse and it wouldn't work with the new batteries. Then I used Duracell and the mouse was fine!Same thing happened with my Roku remote."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Have I sold you yet If not, just imagine sitting on your couch, remote in hand, and all of the sudden you can't change the channel anymore. You can't turn the volume up when your girlfriend is asking you to do stuff. You can't turn the volume up when she does that stupid, annoying, thing when she eats. YOU CAN'T TURN IT UP WHEN SHE'S TALKING TO HER MOM! Before these batteries my relationships did not last long, as girlfriends love asking you to do stuff, eating, talking to their mom. Since my purchase of these batteries, and my ability to turn the volume up to earbleeding levels whenever my girlfriend opens her mouth, I have been much, much happier.Buy these batteries.They probably also work in other things like digital thermostats (to make your house unbearably hot for her menopausal mother), flashlights, and clocks."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These batteries have been performing wonderfully in my clocks and other small appliances. The price is right with Subscribe and Save and I can't beat the quality or price elsewhere. They come nicely packed and shrink wrapped in four packs making them easy to carry. I will definitely continue to purchase.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Great price, and shipped safely and Amazon was efficient with the packaging. I bought this pack to replace a 100 pack of Maxell cheap-o batteries that I bought on Amazon years ago. I finally ran out, and decided to try the Performance Alkaline Batteries from AmazonBasics. Quality so far seems to be good. They have been holding their charge well for the devices I'm using them on. These are primarily being used for wireless keyboards and mice, but the area that I've been able to gauge their performance is in a couple of battery operated LED light strings that I use in my studio. With the old batteries, I noticed that I would get about 48 hours of usage before the lights would start to dim. These batteries have been giving me close to double the life. For the price, quite impressed.It's hard to get too fancy on a review for AA batteries, but these happen to work quite well."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These batteries seem to work great and last plenty long enough for my use cases (remotes, computer mouse, flashlights, etc.)."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I used to by the cheap chinese batteries from HF. Now that I've discovered AmazonBasics I'm now converted. These last much longer and are the best bang for your buck. I will certainly buy more when these run out!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person in LED lights which don't pull a lot of power. I will go for a brand name next time...I can't have my students getting burns from leaky batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I've used! I should send back..
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,These seem to be normal AAA batteries. can't comment yet on life expectancy but for the price they could stand to be near the bottom performance and still be an okay value.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These seem to work just as good as any other AA battery but for SO MUCH CHEAPER. Seems like every battery operated device in our house takes AAs. I buy these as well as the Amazon rechargeable ones and they all work great. No regrets with this purchase.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,These seem to work just as well as the expensive name brands. I will only buy these from now on.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These were so cheap, but they work just as well as name brand batteries. Come in a cardboard box which is so much easier for storage than those cardboard and plastic things"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,why on earth would yo pay for Duracell or Energizer These work great and last a long time !

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,they are batteries and they make my battery powered stuff work so im not sure how this could get a low rating. for the price well worth it. that said they don't seem to last quite as long as other name brands.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,Ours did not last nearly as long as energizer or Duracell in our sons toys. No real data to prove this other than we went through batteries like they were candy until I restocked with energizer.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,they are cheep so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kids toys and they don't last long.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,They make things go! There are many of them! They are not dead on arrival like some competitors.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Yup, batteries cheap. They are packaged like a PITA though and you ahve to rip these outa shrink wrap. Good for commercial resale in a store, since they are then packaged into smaller units for resale, for home use when you what to just dump them into a box and be done for the kids to grab like Halloween candy for all their gear - not easy to do that with. But to of batteries its still a good deal.. just expect some work opening them all up to dump them out."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"These do not last long. I will stick to Kirkland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"The batteries seem to do just as well as any other batteries I might get from the store. I appreciate the effiency of just being able to order them from Amazon, and I like that I can get such a large quantity at a good price."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I'm always satisfied with these batteries
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Very little capacity. They last only about 25 as long when compared with other main stream batteries

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,I am all about Amazon Basics but I have ordered several of these for our baby toys and they don't compare at all to the Duracell ProCell that I normally order. Would love to go for a great generic brand but this just isn't it. I've been through several of these and they are consistently much faster to run out than the ProCells.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,They last a very short time once in use. Put fresh ones in a soap dispenser and they lasted 8 days. Other brand lasted 2 months

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"They are batteries. They make my possessions which require batteries to do their thing. I have not noticed a difference in the time between battery changes because I have more important things to do, but with this price, I'm ok if it isn't the longest lasting in the world. Side note, the packaging on these is quite wonderful. No more taking my life into my hands trying to get at a couple of batteries."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,They seem to not last as long as other brands. Great Price though
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,So far so good.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"This is my second time purchasing these Amazon AA batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I dont know what I could possibly say that over 6,000 other reviewers have not already said.. so I won't even go into details. I needed more AAA batteries, and I am a amazon-junkie so I ordered their batteries. Popped three into a flashlight that needed batteries.. and I had light! They work.. Now how they will hold up over time, I do not know yet.. but they work for now and worked in my flashlight so I am happy with them!"

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Nothing wrong with these batteries.

I am currently using some in a battery operated lanterns, a flash light, and one of my youngest daughters toy. I have not experienced any problems with these.I really like that I can order good quality batteries at a good price and have them delivered to my door.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"These work GREAT and are much more affordable! This pack will last about 2 months but that's because nobody else buys batteries in my house. They all take mine which had become too expensive of a habit for me. They work just as well (if not better!) than the brand I used to buy. I'll be buying other sizes of these to have on hand, especially since they don't break my (limited) wallet!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"They work not bad , but these batteries does not work in some devices, I do not know why This is why I dropped one star off."

It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality."

Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top brands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top brands in the future. We go through a lot of the AA variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but..."

I've used other brands and the so called good fall behind in performance. The top of the line, are really good, but they put a dent in my pocket.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I wish I knew Amazon sold batteries sooner. We live in an isolated community and batteries cost an arm and a leg here. So far they seem to be equivalent to the other name brands. I haven't been using them long enough to tell if they last shorter or longer than other battery brands. This is a great bargain nonetheless. I will probably continue to buy my batteries here from now on.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,This is my 2nd time purchasing these batteries. They last as long as any other brand. I will continue to buy these. I have also started my office buying these.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,3,"And I could have bought Energizer batteries. These are OK, but not a US company. Who knows what damage their manufacture is doing to the planet."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Upon counting, visually inspecting, sampling, and weighed each one, results indicated consistent specs and quality as the ad listing had implied."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,DO not buy this product I've received this product to replace batteries in remote-control candles all three candles did not work I was ready to discard the candles when I decided to try different batteries.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"I often buy Amazon Basic products, and until I tried their batteries I've never had a complaint. But these batteries drain faster than any but the absolute cheapest I've ever used. So no bargain there. You get what you pay for with this, unlike most other Amazon branded items."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,At first I was a little skeptical about getting these batteries but after reading some of the reviews I decided to take a chance and try them for myself.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell. They come close, I think, but definitely not as long. I use AA batteries primarily in my iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, for what it's worth. Still, these amazon batteries are significantly cheaper, so it all probably evens out."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great batteries. Amazon brand is excellent.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I just received these and immediately tested all 24 with my trusty digital multi-meter....22 tested excellent to better than normal, and two tested right in the normal to little less than normalto what any commercial brand battery tests...therefore, I'm very happy with this shipment, but I'll review the life-span in the field with daily use in our irrigation drip system-timers and post that when I have results. thanks Amazon!...I will buy these again!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I'm only going to give it 4 stars since I have not had on go bad yet so I can't say how much longer the name brand batteries will lat until one remote control that I put one off each in it so I'll see what lasted the longest and probley replace this battery and see how much longer the name brand lasts any way the money you save I can afford for them not to last quite as long
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Very happy with these batteries. I have changed from other brands to solely the Amazon batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Great deal and they work fine! Very pleased with these. Comparable to major brands.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Barring that, enjoy!"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't restart without another fresh set of batteries.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,They were very good
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,As good as any other brands like rayovac or that other one I cant think of .
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Very nice product and I'm very happy with it. My experience with this seller was excellent. I would not hesitate to deal with them again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Been using these batteries for almost a year. Very pleased with them
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Don't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Good price, good product"

Won't purchase again!Amazon should reconsider selling these turkeys Wow. Was IDisappointed. How about a replacement for these fake batterieswith real ones!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Awful. Have almost gone through a whole box to find a battery or two that actually work.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. Pay a little more for quality batteries that work.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,I have no issue with the actual batteries. They work fine. My problem is with the extremely wasteful packaging. The 20-pack comes in an oversized cardboard box with two slots for 10 batteries each. They could just as easily package them in a small thin cardboard box.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Good price for batteries. Have only used a few of them thus far, but they work."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Way better price than name brand like engergizer. I have a little boy who needs batteries for everything. This way he don't break the bank.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,We ordered these batteries all the time!

We have a toddler running around our house so as you can imagine ever single toy we own needs batteries.Totally satisfied with our purchase every time!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,We've bought these a few times. We run through batteries like crazy...and these are the very best for the very least. Highly recommend!!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Price and reviews were pretty good, only time will tell..."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,We've ordered these batteries twice now and they're great. They really last in my kids toys and for the price you can't beat it. They last in a furby that's played with just about 14 hours out of the day for over a week (which is awesome!)
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"For the price,they are well worth it."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Well i am a fan of the Amazon Basic items. They are life saver for me.I don't have much to say as Amazon basic quality and economy prices are well know to everyone.Thank you Amazon for the Amazon Basic items.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"Shipped lightning fast! I will never buy another big brand battery - especially for bulk use. Gone through the pack, plenty of juice and long lasting."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,It's been quite a while since I've needed batteries and I didn't want to pay the brick-and-mortar prices. They came well-packaged and according to Amazon they keep well. I haven't needed to use more than 2 but I can say that it came fully powered and I hope they keep as well as advertised!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,decent quality
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I love these batteries. First they are priced cheaper than the name brands but offer the same performance. They come in no frustration packaging instead of the terrible clamshells that most batteries from the store do. The cardboard box offers a handy place to store them in without being cut by the plastic or having them fall out of the pack. Each four batteries is individually sealed so you can place them in odd drawers throughout the house close to the items they will be powering. Finally I can have all the different size high performing batteries I may need without breaking the bank. You won't be disappointed with these.Please check Yes if you have found this review helpful. I rely upon others' reviews to make an informed decision anytime I make a purchase, so it is my intention to help others do the same. I welcome any questions or feedback."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,2,"So these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,"I like most AmazonBasics products I've tried. They are generally good at performing their intended functions without frills: Basic!These AmazonBasics AAA batteries are less than brand name batteries at my local big-box store and appear to work just as well for me. My use in in a keyboard, several remote controls (including Fire TV and Echo remotes), and some radio linked thermometers I bought last century but still work great. I'm sure I use them other places I've forgotten.Do they last as long as Duracell Ultra or whatever super-duper alkaline I might have gotten in the past If they don't, it's not such that I've noticed and that's good enough for me. I'm not into battery performance enough to run tests keep records! If you are, spend more money on famous brand name batteries!What I got was a simple cardboard box with 36 cells group in fours with plastic around each four. A lot like other batteries I've purchased in the last couple of years. No packaging drama and that's nice.The AmazonBasicis AAA batteries perform well enough to satisfy me, are inexpensive, and just fit and work wherever I need AAA cells. Just the basics and that's just what I want. When I get what I want I give 5 stars.Hope this helps someone."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,I decided to give these a try because with s 3 year old and 6.5 month old we go through so many batteries.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,4,I see reviews of these batteries mostly on one end of the spectrum or the other. I love em' or I hate em'. Seems leakage is the culprit in bad reviews. I have had no problems with the AA size batteries I ordered.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Works just as good as other name brand batteries. I can't speak for longevity as these are used in devices that either gets used a lot or sometimes not for a week at a time. So far I would buy again.

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Love these batteries! Wonderful price and a great product!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Worst batteries ever. I use them in my remote and have to switch them every couple of weeks. Do not buy
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME."
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !"
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,1,Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,die hard Ray O Vac user but due to price I am trying these based on reviews.
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48 Count) - Packaging May Vary,5,Finally I have enough batteries! A nice supply of batteries that seem to last as good as any and better than many.

I really love the remote, which allows you to not only dim the lights, but it also has a timer! The individual lights came with two small screws to install, as well as 3M tape.

Great product!"

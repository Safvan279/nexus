            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <p>This project is a Sentiment Analysis Platform designed to analyze customer reviews and feedback using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Built using Flask, the platform allows users to upload datasets containing reviews, which are then processed and analyzed to classify reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments. The system also provides insights into customer emotions, such as joy, anger, and calmness, based on the sentiment of the reviews.
                In addition to sentiment classification, the project integrates a machine learning component using a Random Forest Classifier to train on the user-uploaded dataset and provide sentiment predictions. The web interface is built with user-friendly features, including file upload, real-time sentiment analysis, and downloadable results.

            <h1>Key Features</h1>
            <h3>User-friendly Interface:</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li>Intuitive and clean design for users to easily upload review datasets.</li>
                <li>Results are displayed in a tabular format, showcasing sentiment and emotion for each review</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Real-time Sentiment Analysis:</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li>As soon as a dataset is uploaded, the system preprocesses the data and runs a sentiment analysis using the TextBlob library.</li>
                <li> Sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral) are identified, and corresponding emotions are assigned based on the analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Machine Learning Integration</h3>
            <li>The platform trains a Random Forest Classifier model on the uploaded dataset to enhance sentiment prediction capabilities.</li>
            <li>Both the model and the vectorizer used for feature extraction are saved for future use, ensuring faster predictions for similar datasets.</li>


            <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
            <li>A bar chart representing the distribution of sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral) is generated and displayed on the dashboard.</li>
            <li>Users can download this chart for further analysis and presentations.</li>


            <h3>Downloadable Results:</h3>

            <li>The analyzed dataset, including sentiment and emotion classifications, is available for download as a CSV file.</li>
            <li>The sentiment distribution chart is also downloadable for users who want a visual summary of the analysis.</li>

            <h3>Data Preprocessing:</h3>
            <li>Text reviews are preprocessed to remove noise (punctuation, numbers, and stopwords).</li>
            <li>Lemmatization is applied using spaCy to normalize words and improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis.</li>
